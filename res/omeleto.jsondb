Dennis also has a head that looks like a bag of money, which makes him feel shy and inhibited, and also makes him the butt of many jokes.\n\nBut then Dennis goes on a date with a magazine cartoonist named Catherine, and the pair make a romantic connection. But when he finds himself the subject of a joke on a national scale,  he starts to question if he'll ever find someone to connect with at all.\n\nWritten and directed by Patrick O'Brien, this quirky romantic short has an absurdist premise, with the main character with a literal bag of money for a head, and the film finds humor in how people -- including a homeless man, played by punk legend Henry Rollins -- react to Dennis's difference. But with its blend of melancholy, yearning and vulnerability, it's also a deeply romantic film that will resonate with anyone who has felt despondent or anxious in their search for someone to love and accept them as they are.\n\nThe storytelling takes a low-key approach to its absurdist premise, incorporating it matter-of-factly into its dim, muted naturalistic cinematography. The approach and tone are not unlike the work of early Spike Jonze, which also incorporates bizarre twists on reality in ways that invite comment on societal norms and conventions. Dennis's head allows the narrative to examine, with sometimes mordant humor and imagination, how we treat differently-abled and differently-bodied people, and how the world at large often comments on them as if they were objects of fascination and not people.\n\nDennis himself has a very everyman quality that feels very relatable, especially in his loneliness and desire for connection. Actor Chris Grace gives an excellent, sympathetic performance, and his ease and fluency with voice, gestures and body language more than makes up for the lack of conventional facial expressions from having his face covered as a performer. The scene when Dennis and Catherine make a connection is sweetly touching, which makes its disastrous denouement all the more understandably heartbreaking -- and even dangerous -- for Dennis.\n\nBut happily for Dennis and viewers invested in his story, \"Moneybag Head\" ends on a heartwarming note that feels genuinely earned, especially after all that Dennis has been through. Yet the sweet ending avoids feeling too saccharine because the story never shies away from how indifferent or even cruel the world can be to those who don't quite fit in, and how debilitating it is to be judged quickly without any room for complexity. In such a context, it celebrates connection as the minor miracle that it is.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Quite unexpectedly, a ball falls from the other side. He kicks it over, only to have it returned. He then meets another boy, Khaled, on the other side.\n\nA friendship soon develops between the two, and they find ways to play and bond with one another, even with the wall between them. But as the realities of where they live come to the fore, their friendship may not quite survive.\n\nCharming, sweet and full of thoughtful simplicity, this short captures how the innocence and delight of childhood friendship can flourish in even the most polarizing of situations. The images and cinematography are pared down, even elegant, and the camerawork graceful and compelling. But these elements of craft never get in the way of telling a humanistic story that focuses on the common ground between people and the essential bonds of connection.\n\nAll the events of the narrative are framed through the eyes of children, who have the gift of taking one another as they are. The sequence between Nathan and Khaled as they cultivate a friendship despite the barrier between them is hopeful and heartwarming as it builds their relationship through gifts, gestures and time spent with one another. Despite very little dialogue, it conveys the truth that young children have an innate openness and belief in goodness, and an ability to enjoy themselves despite the turmoil of the world around them.\n\nThough the storytelling's center is Nathan, the film also possesses an almost observational quality, whether it's in the wide shots or how at-large events and ideas are woven into the narrative action and background sound. Slowly the realities of their world creep in, and Nathan finds himself worried about Khaled during a skirmish and sets out to warn him.\n\nThe tension here is not played for suspense or thrills, though viewers worry and question Khaled's safety as Nathan does. Instead, the magic and innocence of childhood are ruptured, and Nathan sees an inkling of the deep-seated complexities of the conflict at work.\n\nYoung actors Adi Weiss as Nathan and Assi Goffer as Khaled play the friends with guileless charm and lightness, but also capture the flickers of anxiety that come from living amidst a long-running conflict. We root for their friendship, even when we question whether or not their friendship will survive the realities of the wall and all that it represents. Nathan begins to have doubts as well, and when he confronts the cold realities of their situation, he nevertheless goes to help his friends, despite the danger he puts himself in.\n\nTold with great empathy and focused on the experiences of its young characters, \"Over the Wall\" portrays the belief that humanity has more common ground at its core, and holds fast to the beauty of this idea. But it's also not naive, especially when we arrive at the film's end, which reaches a heartbreaking conclusion all the more poignant for its restraint and simplicity. The final feeling is one of bereft sadness at what potential -- of joy, friendship and understanding -- is lost for Nathan and Khaled, and the world at large.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The melee is bloody and violent, and the gang of hooligans shows no mercy, rounding up survivors of the attack and executing them if they don't prove useful.\n\nBut when a minstrel finds himself face to face with death, he offers the murderers and thieves something that catches their attention: immortality through song. He is forced to compose the tune on the spot, incorporating members of the gang and changing details to suit their whims -- and the result is the accidental birth of a legend.\n\nWritten and directed by Will Kenning, this clever comedy short begins with a fight sequence set in medieval times that would make any fans of Game of Thrones intrigued, full as it is of gruesome kills and brutal violence. But there are clues that things aren't quite what they seem, particularly when they round up survivors for execution, and spend a considerable amount of time debating over if and why they should kill someone.\n\nThe dialogue and performances expertly sketch out the various personalities at work in the gang, using sharp, focused wit in the writing and performances to dig underneath the surface of this group of killers. Though they're amoral and violent, these aren't the brightest band of criminals overall, and as a result, they spend a lot of time squabbling and bickering like childish buffoons.\n\nAs the story slows down to focus on the minstrel's dilemma, his negotiations and on-the-fly composition cleverly reveal the various egos, tensions and tender points at work with various members, who insist upon revisions of their verses. The process is also a showcase for the cast's collective performance, which expertly treads the line between broad comedy and a more subtle specificity with each character.\n\nAs a result, much of the humor comes out of watching the foibles of human ego and delusion at work, and it sits easily with the menace of violence that the film builds up early on and teases later in the action. As the minstrel writes his song, viewers begin to catch onto just who this group is. The reveal is gradual and carefully built up, but then it dawns on us just who we've spent time with -- and how far they are from the legend.\n\nEntertaining, attention-grabbing and clever, \"The Legend of Bob Leonard\" is essentially about how history is the ultimate game of \"telephone,\" with a focus on the gap between the glamorous, even noble image painted by the storytelling and the messier reality. Bob Leonard and his gang of violent miscreants don't quite have the valor or nobility of the legend, and the film's humor exploits the gap in a smart, witty way, all while capturing the action with visual panache and style. It's all in great fun, as is the finished song, though \"Bob Leonard\" doesn't quite have the impact it should. No worries, though... there's nothing a little historical revision can't fix.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Her mother is also in the throes of intense grief and has become almost entirely inaccessible to Ana.\n\nTo help heal her mother, Ana prays to God to help ease the pain, but to no avail. Her mother only goes deeper into her pain, causing deeper rifts in the family. Feeling desperate and alone, Ana decides to court divine intervention in her own way, to break through the impasse of grief that has frozen the family emotionally.\n\nWritten and directed by Cris Gris, this dramatic short uses a sensitive and economical naturalism to capture both a young girl's attempt to process an unthinkable loss and the atmosphere of religious belief and faith that surrounds the family.\n\nConsiderable delicacy is used in picking just the right image to encapsulate Ana's increasing isolation. The young girl's milieu is both lively with color and heavy with shadow, captured with camerawork that is beautifully attuned to Ana's inner world and emotions. Though she says very little, the audience always knows her thoughts and feelings, thanks to this intuitive camera and editing.\n\nThe camera also pays documentary-like attention to the small details of Ana's Mexican town, and to how spiritual belief and religious piety are imbued into the fabric of this community. All kinds of rituals and spiritual interventions are available at any turn in Ana's world, and faith in God and saints are a palpable part of everyone's lives. These are woven naturally into the film through the narrative action, as well as through a richly layered sound and musical score.\n\nAna may be a child, but the emotions of death, afterlife and loss are just as huge and paralyzing for her as they are for her mother. And yet she's unable to be seen or heard, perhaps because she is so young. Young actress Melissa Pena Rodriguez offers a restrained yet evocative performance, as a young girl seeking meaning, comfort and understanding but unable to find it anywhere. In the vacuum of any guidance, and emotionally left to her own devices, she asks God to intercede with a show of faith that may only lead to more calamity.\n\nSelected for the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, \"San Miguel\" is a compelling and ultimately heart-wrenching portrait of how we make sense of devastating sorrow. It's also an intimate, richly specific immersion into the director's hometown of Monterrey, Mexico, where the film was shot. Amidst these ambitious themes, Ana's intimate story stands out for its exquisite sensitivity to the inner life of children, and also how easily the world overlooks this. And in its final, devastating moments, it also makes clear the costs of this short-sightedness, when we can't see or address the pain standing right in front of us, hoping to be heard.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They are both soulmates who send one another sweet missives and gifts, and they look at one another longingly across the distance. But they have never met because they are both painfully shy.\n\nBut as the pair of would-be lovers pine for one another, fate decides to take matters into its own hands, pulling Clarence and Ernestine together -- and pulling viewers into a lovely magical fantasia at the same time.\n\nDirected by John Alan Thompson from a script co-written with Amy Thompson, this enchanting short fantasy romance combines stop-motion animation, charming miniature work and a whimsical narrative to craft a sweetly surreal love story that warms the heart and dazzles the eyes.\n\nThe film has a classic European feel in its textured, expressionistic visuals, with the various filmmaking techniques complementing one another to create a unique fairytale-like world. The mixture of stop-motion animation, miniatures and live-action offer a wealth of beautifully crafted intricate detail and a romantic atmosphere, from the lovely cityscape where Clarence and Ernestine live to the charming birds and flowers that fill their homes. It all comes together beautifully to create a cohesive, captivating magical world -- quite an accomplishment in and of itself -- but the visual panache never gets in the way of the old-fashioned romance at its core.\n\nThere is also moody, saturated darkness to the lighting and cinematography that is reminiscent of the classic fantastical films of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, whose 'Amelie' has a similar look-and-feel. This slight darkness presages the surreal turn that the story takes, as it hops, skips and cartwheels through each beat of the story. Two very important parts of the would-be sweethearts take it upon themselves to express the feelings and yearnings that are suppressed due to the potential couple's shyness. The \"twist\" is a bit of an unexpected, playful turn, but it works well as part of the fairy-tale aesthetic of the short.\n\nThe writing isn't heavy on dialogue, but much of the narrative is guided by a warmly engaging voiceover by Hollywood screen veteran Robert Wagner. And the two lead performers -- Pat Healy as Clarence and Kali Rocha as Ernestine -- are as engaging and expressive as Hollywood silent-film stars, in a nostalgic style of storytelling that emphasizes almost postcard-like tableaux over unspooling continuous action. But these little chapters come together into a final sequence that has the compelling, suspenseful movement and dynamism of an action film -- and culminates in a sweeping finale that is as funny, beguiling and heartwarming as any old-fashioned silver screen romance.\n\nArtfully crafted, visually distinctive and quirky in both humor and sensibility, \"Lend a Hand for Love\" has charm galore, but its eccentricities in storytelling and image keep it from becoming too saccharine. Its edgier flourishes are perhaps key to making the romance feel genuine and sweet because, in truth, many of us are too shy or beset by struggles of all sorts to act on the deepest yearnings of our heart. The storytelling handles this emotional truth with lightness and creativity, but much of the film's artistry is continually connected to this truth. The result is a cinematic valentine with humor, playfulness and genuine sweetness, but like the best of fairy tales, it also has a visionary flourish in bringing the harder parts of human nature to life and questioning what parts of ourselves we aren't expressing.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They are really into the music, having a great time together, and clearly enjoy one another's company.\n\nBut then a phone call interrupts their music. The call for Beccs, from a guy named J.J., who she admits is one of her boyfriends. This rubs Joshua the wrong way: even though he has only started dating Beccs, he knows he likes her, and he is a commitment kind of guy. As they talk, Beccs reveals she is polyamorous. The two attempt to understand one another's views, but the gulf between them might prove too far for either to cross.\n\nDirected by Daniel Daniel, who co-wrote the script with co-star Avigail Tlalim, this short relationship drama is focused, economical and spare in execution, but it's also a prime example of how far excellent writing and performances can go to portray the tremendous complexity of modern dating and human desire.\n\nShot as a one-take, the film generates interest not with the push and pull of editing or the dazzle of slick cinematography. Instead, it puts the words and feelings of these two characters front and center, and the confined setting of the car feels almost like being on a \"fly on the wall\" in this potential couple's trajectory.\n\nThe storytelling takes considerable time at the beginning to see the pair at a point of childlike abandon. The couple takes an almost primal joy in each other's company, able to be silly and uninhibited with one another. But Beccs has to come clean with Joshua about the other men in her life and, more importantly, about her general stance about relationships.\n\nThe film then transitions into the \"meat\" of the film, as they engage in a discussion on Beccs's polyamory and Joshua's more traditional take on relationships. The drive-thru provides an aptly ribald metaphor for Beccs, who explains that she likes to \"dip [her] chip in many sauces,\" and doesn't want to miss out on any of her favorites.\n\nThe writing is honest, clever and non-judgmental about both sides, and the characters are generous and kind with one another as they attempt to understand their difference, a dynamic that underscores their compatibility and fundamental decency with one another.\n\nThe terrific rapport between the actors themselves -- Tlalim as Beccs and Michael Workeye as Joshua -- gives the film a certain dynamism and musicality, especially as they negotiate the ebbs and flows of the feelings that come up. They vacillate between tension and humor, and by the time Beccs's phone rings again, she and the viewer are left with questions of whether what she has with Joshua is worth giving up her polyamory, and just what she will do.\n\nWith a solid foundation of excellent writing and performance, \"Sauce\" takes on a modern issue in the contemporary dating landscape, but it's also about the moment when two people, who adore one another, must confront their intentions for the relationship, and perhaps even about their lives. The dilemma is the abundance of romantic possibilities and adventures that Beccs wants to experience, versus the special bond, solidity and even love that Joshua offers. Just how singular and unique is the freedom and joy she experiences with Joshua and is she willing to risk giving that up? The question hangs in the air for the characters, and will likely haunt Beccs and viewers after the film's end.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She also tries to instill a sense of security and stability for her son, shielding him from the difficulty of their life. But when Ronnie's asthma flares up, Molly must face the precariousness of her life, despite all of her attempts towards normality.\n\nWritten and directed by David Mandell and starring actor Troian Bellisario from TV favorite \"Pretty Little Liars,\" this short drama puts a personal, emotional face on the widespread problem of homelessness. It combines a visual naturalism, with handheld camerawork utilized in an almost doc-like way to capture the telling details of this family's world, from the way they brush their teeth in a public fountain to the lived-in interior of their car.\n\nThe writing, though, patiently builds up the emotional reality of homelessness for this particular woman and her child. It focuses on Molly's dilemma, as she must manage the logistical hurdles of having no permanent address and few job prospects while trying to be emotionally stable and available to her vulnerable young son. The storytelling and editing focus on this psychological juggling act, making for an emotionally intimate experience for the viewer.\n\nWith its expressive musical score and the nature of the material, the film could easily fall into melodrama. But it's held together by a finely nuanced performance by Bellisario, who offers up an unvarnished, raw portrayal of a woman struggling against great odds. What works about her performance is how it places Molly's role as a mother and protector at the foreground of her character.\n\nFrom one scene to the next, she is always a mother trying to do her best for her son, whether it's in the warm, patient way she talks and plays with Ronnie to her impatience and frustration when he demands a cheeseburger instead of the sandwich given to them. When she comes up against the obstacles that arise from their economic and social precariousness, it is always seen within the framework of motherhood, and it is never played for victimhood.\n\nMolly never gives up, is as resourceful as possible in her circumstances and is always connected to the love and obligation she feels as a mother. As a result, Molly's strength, vulnerability and immense love always shine through each moment of the short, even when she hits her lowest point and can no longer protect Ronnie from the harsh reality of their life.\n\n\"Like Turtles\" ends with some sobering statistics about homelessness, which dovetail with its objective to give viewers an intimate, emotional understanding of the \"slippery slope\" that often leads to permanent homelessness. Molly has a lot of persistence and a bit of luck, but sadly, many people who struggle with homelessness in real life don't. Storytelling like this aims to invoke empathy and compassion to put us into another's shoes. It's an almost old-fashioned approach -- except that it is still so necessary in a world where problems like homelessness continue to persist, and people like Molly fall deeper in the cracks of society, to be forgotten or overlooked.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Claire has endometriosis, a widespread but poorly understood tissue disorder that affects women's reproductive systems, causing immense pain, heavy bleeding and painful sex. Claire's condition is so painful that she needs to have her uterus removed, but she wants to keep her ovaries in hopes that she can have a biological child in some way in the future.\n\nJaq, too, has endometriosis, though it's not as advanced as Claire's yet. In some ways, Jaq is defiant about her endo and doesn't want to let it affect her life. She dates and has sex like any modern woman in London, but she hides her condition and refuses to talk much or even acknowledge it. But even Jaq can't escape the very messy reality of her condition, and her inability to talk openly about it sabotages a promising relationship and satisfying sex life. But when Claire's surgery takes a sad turn, Jaq realizes that she must learn to talk about it with openness.\n\nQuirky, bold and remarkably expansive, this short comedy -- written by Elaine Gracie, directed by Alice Seabright and produced by  Alexandra Blue and Kate Phibbs -- is both one woman's journey into accepting a difficult reality and a deep dive into a poorly understood condition that affects millions of women. These women often suffer silently with the myriad ways it can debilitate normal life. With playfulness in the aesthetic approach and a grounding in emotional and physical reality, it captures their experience in an accessible, creatively accomplished way.\n\nThe visual approach and storytelling of the film are fun-loving and even whimsical, starting with its central visual image of a woman's reproductive system, recreated with food. The film returns to this image as Jaq's story progresses, with parts of the tableau deteriorating as her biology flares up and rebels against her, shifting into the realm of the surreal. Even the brighter, punchy lighting gets dimmer and more muted as Jaq is forced to reckon with how her endometriosis affects her life.\n\nThe tone of the film is a complex one, and in many ways is its creative high-wire act. The humor is often dry and tongue-in-cheek, with impishly cheerful dialogue about serious, sometimes devastating realities. The pacing and structure, too, have an unusual complexity for a short film, as it zigzags between past and present at an almost frolicsome pace. As it moves along, the writing weaves in facts about endometriosis, and brings to life how endo concretely affects the lived reality of many women, with its inconvenient bleeding, immense pain and the medical establishment's indifference and sometimes condescending attitude towards it.\n\n\"End-o\" accomplishes two things in its storytelling: it tells a compelling tale with visual panache, and it educates viewers about an under-researched and little-understood condition that affects millions of women's lives, bring something shrouded in silence into the open. It would be easy to go into \"movie of the week\" territory at times, but the film's bold creative choices and the nimble, grounded lead performances by Sophie Di Martino as Jaq and Lisa Jackson as Claire put a human face and emotions onto the factoids, helping viewers empathize as they confront pain, embarrassment and even infertility. More must be done to understand something that impacts so many women, but as Jaq comes to learn, much of it begins with a willingness to be open and speak up about it and shed the shame that makes the suffering so much worse.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But when a co-worker comes in, they demand to know the reason for his strange nickname.\n\nOnce they discover just why he has such a moniker for a nickname, the once convivial mood in the lounge is ruptured, and the other teachers are revolted and disgusted. But their way of regaining equilibrium is just as extreme.\n\nAbsurdist, darkly comic, and furtively philosophical, this singular comedy short from Sweden is as unforgettable and thought-provoking as the central demonstration at the heart of the film. It combines a unique approach to craft and storytelling with a willingness to skate the edge between the realist and the fantastical. Throw in a very dry Scandinavian sense of humor, and it becomes an uncomfortable indictment of the darker impulses of humanity.\n\nWhat's immediately striking about the film is its restless, almost anxious visual style. Shot with a muted, almost bleak naturalistic sense of color and light, the camera never quite settles into a shot, often re-framing or zooming in and out of the action, which feels unsettling and even unnatural for the human eye. There are also no real establishing shots, and the audience never quite settles into the place and setting of the story before the co-worker reveals the reason for his unusual nickname and all hell breaks loose in the lounge.\n\nThe film is unusual in that there is no central main character, whose journey we follow as they attempt to navigate a series of obstacles or come to a shift in realization or consciousness.  Instead, the crux of the storytelling revolves around a \"before and after\" structure, and the shock of the difference between the two halves. The group is established as cultured, reasonable and thoughtful. But after the co-worker reveals his secret, the previously intelligent, civilized group turns shocked, fearful and repulsed. It's darkly funny and absurd because the transformation is so extreme and the sentiments expressed are so outlandish.\n\nThe narrative could be played for farce, which would be easy and cheap to do. But the visual style becomes even more anxious and even forensic in capturing the extremity of the reaction, raising questions of just how far the story itself will go. As a result, it achieves a strange depth as we watch how quickly and savagely human beings can react in the face of the strange and different, and how negative emotion can be a dangerous social contagion.\n\nPeculiar but always fascinating to watch, \"The Owl\" may remind some viewers of the oeuvre of Yorgos Lanthimos, whose films often resemble human psychological experiments in their fantastical premises. And like Lanthimos's films, this particularly thought-provoking short is also oddly compelling and enjoyable in its comedy, and profoundly philosophical in its observation of human savagery and civility. There's a similar mixture here of puckishly mischievous black humor with surrealist action and horrific dystopian impulses, but perhaps with an even more restless impulse towards visual experimentation.\n\nThe twist of \"The Owl\" is not quite a surprise, and in some ways, neither are the teachers' reactions, though they're shocking in their extremity. Some viewers will find parallels to witch hunts, cancel culture, comment sections and other ways that the human impulse to annihilate or punish what we fear can snowball without any balances to keep it in check. However it's interpreted, the story will linger with viewers for some time in an unsettling, even unnerving way.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They chat about their days and their lives with ease and then buy a winter coat together.\n\nBut an act of petty crime reveals a much more subtle and intricate connection between the pair, one whose bond both persists and strengthens in difficult circumstances.\n\nWriter-director Werner Vivier's short drama seems initially uneventful but in the most subtle ways. Much of the action is focused on the conversation between the woman and the child, and the storytelling ambles along with their friendly, warm back-and-forth. But this emphasis on the ordinariness and connection between the pair ultimately reveals its true richness and importance once their entire situation is unraveled, forming a powerful meditation on family, connection and what it means to be there for someone else.\n\nThough essentially a two-hander in many ways, the short feels bigger, especially as Nathalie and Wayne go about their East London neighborhood and viewers can situate them in terms of social and economic status. Their dialogue is rich and skillful, with Nathalie taking an in-depth interest in Wayne that is compelling in its warmth, solicitousness, kindness and balance of concern and non-judgment. The impression between them is great trust and care, and clearly they mean a lot to one another.\n\nActors Angie Adler as Nathalie and Buddy Skelton as Wayne have an easygoing rapport with one another, making them a pleasure to watch and observe. They manage to feel highly specific as characters and universal in their evocation of the maternal bond, down to the very way Nathalie urges Wayne to finish his food, to his comical protest. But as the film unfolds into its conclusion, the truth is a little more complicated, though no less touching and even more important to a young child growing up in a challenging environment.\n\n\"Winter Coat\" is not a film that relies on a twist, but the gradual full reveal of Wayne's background underscores what an extraordinary relationship he has with Nathalie. The film's true gift then becomes how it celebrates the power of the seemingly ordinary, almost mundane moments between them, one that we almost take for granted as examples of familial love and connection. We understand in the end how valuable this connection is for Wayne, and we also understand how seemingly simple yet truly remarkable the work of mothering is, and just what it means to have that in your life.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But weeks after their tryst, he gets a voicemail message from her. The problem? Because she doesn't speak English, he can't understand a word that she says.\n\nHe attempts to hunt down the woman and find a way to translate the message, a quest that takes him on an odyssey across the city. But as his hopes look increasingly futile, his journey turns philosophical, as he makes peace with the fact that he'll never see her again.\n\nWritten and directed by James Soldan, this short comedy hits almost operatic notes of grandeur and romance as it follows a twenty-something layabout on his quest to find the supposed love of his life. Though it's less than eight minutes long, it travels a great distance, both narratively and emotionally speaking, as Joel confronts the sorrows and joys of love.\n\nThe tone is exaggerated, almost satirical, echoing Joel's increasing desperation to find out exactly what Jing Fei is saying and where she possibly could be. The writing is nimble, and the pace is constantly moving, with Joel's narration touching on the ebbs and flows of his emotions and thoughts as he tries to find Jing Fei.\n\nThe storytelling pokes fun at Joel, who goes through great -- and sometimes ridiculous -- lengths to decipher Jing Fei's missive, including ordering food from Chinese restaurants in the hopes that a delivery person will help him translate the message. There's also gentle fun poked at Joel's cultural stereotyping and over-reliance on tired romantic tropes, which the writing hits upon with a light hand (and which will get Joel in a bit of trouble eventually). Likewise, there's an almost documentary-like look and feel to the camerawork at first, capturing Joel in his mundane environment.\n\nBut as Joel's quest gets more desperate, that naturalism falls to the wayside, and the images and editing become more expressionistic and exaggerated. In some parts, the film even resembles a music video for an 80s power ballad, to humorous effect. The clever, intelligent performance becomes like a wild-eyed Byronic romantic hero. It culminates in a wistful moment of contemplation, which allows him to finally let go of the thwarted romance and make peace with never seeing his great love again.\n\n\"Semi Skimmed\" ends with one final twist of a punchline, which allows one last hearty laugh but also reframes the film. Not to give it away, but it allows viewers to examine the relationship between mental projection and love, and the gap between the great emotion and connection in our heads versus what exists in reality. It's also a wry commentary on how this also intersects with Joel's blithe cultural ignorance, which backfires on him at the end. That Joel is blissfully unaware of all of this is perhaps the final joke of the film, though we can't help but hope he figures it out sooner than later.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

It's a celebration for her childhood best friend Amy -- only Amy's been dead for 18 years.\n\nSarah, along with Amy's family, has gone along with this ritual for years. But seen through the eyes of her boyfriend, Sarah begins to observe how this annual gathering has frozen the family for almost two decades -- and how she must confront the past for everyone to move forward.\n\nWritten by Melissa Jane Osborne and directed by Nell Teare, viewers may easily believe from the description that this story is a drama. But as a dark comedy, it peels back the layers of a strange, eccentric birthday party, initially building up a sense of bright, almost whimsical oddness. But through a deft, skillful and ultimately compassionate sleight-of-hand in the writing, it reveals the painful truth at the core of the situation with undeniable impact and resonance.\n\nThe most striking visuals of the short revolve around the combination of aggressively cheerful, sun-filled suburbia and the bright fanciful details of a child's birthday party, with its colorful unicorn-themed cake and pinatas. The aesthetic is eye-catching, but with the 80s hair and a certain studied rigidity in both the decor and the behavior of the hostess, viewers can tell something is off.\n\nThe excellent writing skillfully utilizes the boyfriend's POV to lay out key exposition and also immerse viewers into an odd milieu with slightly different rules from the outside world. Adam gamely plays along with Sarah, as do many of the other family members and guests, with varying degrees of acceptance, understanding and reluctance.\n\nAmy's mother Kim emerges as the party's \"true believer,\" and while the film finds some comedy in how far she goes -- and how much the other partygoers are willing to indulge her -- the humor is never mean-spirited or overly sharp. Instead, it underlines just how Amy's mother has been stuck in time by her grief over her daughter's death, and in turn kept others from moving on as well, including Sarah.\n\nActor Luci MacNair offers a grounded performance as Sarah, who confronts her past and her survivor's guilt, but as Amy's grieving mother, actor Wendy Haines's performance is the emotional center of the film. Kim's deep denial keeps her from facing the full extent of her loss, and watching the collapse of the scaffolding that she's built to prevent her from confronting her daughter's death is key to the film's powerfully wrenching ending.\n\nThough there's a final moment of humor at the film's end, \"Always Remember Me\" -- which is inspired by true events -- possesses a gut-wrenching emotion that can be difficult for dark comedies to pull off. But it works here because the storytelling never forgets the tragedy of losing a child, and the emotional truth that grief can often immobilize us from moving forward in life. Denial may insulate us for some time from the harsh reality of loss, but in the end, sorrow catches up with us -- and the only choice is to acknowledge and accept the pain of it, and finally move ahead with a lot of courage and strength.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But her dream hits a roadblock when she gets spasmodic dysphonia, a condition that causes uncontrollable spasms in the vocal cords and cuts off her full vocal expressiveness.\n\nThe news hampers young Gaby's dreams, and as she grows into adulthood, she has a hard time finding her footing, even with supportive family and loved ones. She sinks into inertia and anxiety, which worsens when a personal tragedy strikes. But then she gets a unique shot at her dream, which forces her to not give up on herself -- and embrace her full self, so-called flaws and all.\n\nWritten and directed by Shane Hartline, this warmly relatable short dramedy weaves together a portrait of living with an unusual condition with a journey about pursuing your dreams and embracing your full self. Both narrative strands are woven together with a sensitive, winning performance from lead actor Trilby Glover and a wry sense of humor in the writing.\n\nThe film opens with video footage of a young Gaby performing, playing characters and acting out stories. Charming, funny and engaging, the montage is key to understanding Gaby's innate gift and potential, and its memory hangs over the narrative as it skips over time into Gaby's adulthood, where she flounders in unfulfilling jobs and hides her condition from others.\n\nWith the scope of a feature, the narrative spans a wide swath of Gaby's life and encapsulates many difficulties in her life. It's held together by a voiceover that expresses Gaby's inner reactions and thoughts. While films sometimes over-rely on voiceover to do the heavy lifting of storytelling, it plays a key role here in viewers' understanding of Gaby's character. We hear the sarcastic, dry thoughts of a tough-minded young woman in a perfect voice, but onscreen, we see Gaby struggle with expressing herself -- not just because of her vocal condition, but from her shame, self-consciousness and embarrassment. The gap is painful for Gaby, and she struggles to express her authentic full self.\n\nLead actor Trilby Glover captures the difficulty of navigating this gulf, expressing the full spectrum of emotions while never becoming overwrought. That restraint -- along with a visual approach that is straightforward and gives breathing room to key images and moments -- keeps the film from creeping into treacly territory. Instead, it delivers a consistently engaging, absorbing story and a main character whose condition is a significant -- but not the only -- defining trait of her self. Instead, Gaby must learn to accept who she is and find her voice in the true sense of the word.\n\n\"Cookie\" is based on the director's own experience with spasmodic dysphonia, which has not inhibited him from pursuing a career both in front of and behind the camera. Empathetic and humane, it makes a case for defining ourselves not by our limitations, but by our capabilities and dreams. Gaby's pursuit to fulfill her talent and express her innermost light isn't valuable because of the end achievement, but because she summoned the courage to go after it. In doing so, she learns to be who she is without apologies -- something that will propel her forward and grow, no matter what life throws at her.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She's going abroad for her cancer treatment but discovers her health is too poor for her to travel.\n\nA pair of strangers drive past the rich woman. They are on the way into a house in the woods, where a poor man is dying. The younger man, who is perhaps a family member, asks for his boots for work since the poor man won't need them anymore. But the man exacts a promise from him to be buried in his backyard with a headstone. The next day, the poor man dies.\n\nThe rich woman eventually dies as well. Though surrounded by the comfort that her wealth can buy, her passing is painful and lonely, and she accuses her nurse of neglect and incompetence. Meanwhile, with the poor man buried as requested, the young man who inherited his boots is reminded of his promise. He goes out into the woods and chops down a tree to make a simple cross for a headstone. The tree dies peacefully in the forest, its wood used to mark the burial site of the poor man.\n\nDirected by Jay Dockendorf from a script he adapted from a Leo Tolstoy short story, this elegantly crafted short drama is a poetic and philosophical meditation on mortalities of all kinds. Shot on 35mm, it has a luminosity to its cinematography, and its elegiac pace and attention to absorbing detail evoke the intensity of a spiritual epiphany, where ordinary life takes on new transcendence of meaning.\n\nThe film's craftsmanship takes its inspiration from European auteurs like Robert Bresson, eschewing the pacing and dynamism of classical storytelling in favor of patient observation. Shots are elongated in duration and capture time and existence in a way that both heightens and flattens ordinary life. This studied, distant approach emphasizes both the universality of death and the specificity of the responses to it.\n\nA selection at the Sundance Film Festival in 2020, \"Three Deaths\" stays true to the Leo Tolstoy story that inspired it. Though the characters are transposed into our more modern era, the narrative of the film also creates a collective portrait of humanity's response to death. One death is marked by pain and hypocrisy, with intense resistance to a life's final passage all the way through. The other human death is faced with great practicality and simplicity, though the aftermath of it is handled like just another daily chore to get through.\n\nThe final and perhaps most resonant death simply is, though it comes at the hands of the thoughtlessness of human beings and perhaps adds an environmental slant that nicely complements Tolstoy's original extolling of nature in his story. Simple, profound and rich in spiritual insight, it provokes questions of how we might ourselves face the one thing that no human can escape, no matter how much we live in denial of it.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He enlists the help of his best friend, Eddie, who's loyal but also a bit of a doofus. But Stacey doesn't seem to notice Alex as more than a friend and neighbor.\n\nBut then a meteorite crashes on the outskirts of their small Australian town. Intrigued and curious, Alex and Eddie join forces with Stacey, who's a space enthusiast, to investigate. Their ad-hoc exhibition seems hopeless, though Alex and Stacey get to know one another better. But when they stumble across a smoking barn. Alex and Stacey investigate, discovering both their feelings for one another and something out of this world.\n\nWritten by Stephanie and Jaclyn and directed by Nick Crowhurst, this short sci-fi short harkens back to the innocence, imaginative fancy and charm of classic 1980s films like \"E.T.\" or \"The Goonies,\" which capture the restless aimlessness of childhood and the thirst for adventure that aims to fill the empty hours.\n\nThough the film clearly has a nostalgic feel, from the set and costumes to the synth-heavy musical score, the storytelling has unforced ease and naturalism. The narrative itself may not be innovative, but it doesn't aim to be. Instead, the storytelling finds comfort and fun in the rites and rituals of youth (and capturing a time before helicopter parenting, constant parental anxiety and social media cancel culture.) But the dialogue and its attentiveness to the budding hopes and insecurities of first crushes are sharp and lively, and the emotions feel classic and true to young teenagers past, present and future.\n\nThe visual craft, too, finds a nice balance between an evocation of sweeping, dynamic 1980s Spielberg fantasy and a relaxed, loose naturalism that captures the placidity of the small town and the vistas of rural Australia. Though the narrative clips along at an engaging pace, viewers are given the space to absorb the world and particularly the characters, who are brought to life with great ease and charm by the film's young cast, led by actor Sebastien Skubala, whose understated and sweet as the boy with a crush on the whip-smart girl-next-door, played deftly by Kiki Nicholls. The trio of characters has a great rapport, particularly as they play off actor Liam Daughtry, who carries off the role of humorous foil Eddie well. Collectively they have a lovely understated quality in their performances but are also able to hit moments of comic pique when needed.\n\n\"Down to Earth\" ends on a cliffhanger, and the short is clearly the opening chapter of a much larger story. Though this short works well as a snapshot of first love and crushes amidst great adventure, audiences will want more, especially because the young characters are so compelling and charming to watch. It's an entertaining, beguiling and warmly engaging reminder that no matter what is happening in the world -- whether it's the real world of politics and strife or the fictional one of alien apocalypses -- there is still magic to be found in ordinary moments of love and friendship.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Since childhood, she's been gifted with creativity and talent. But she lives in a world and comes from a family that fails to make much room for it.\n\nOne day as she's drawing on the street, a businessman recognizes her gift and offers her a job as an illustrator in a greeting card factory. She goes to work, but soon discovers that the relentless grind deadens her imagination. Forced to fight for her talent, she must pull herself out of a trap that gets increasingly difficult with each effort she makes to defy it.\n\nTextured, richly imagined and with an almost Dickensian sense of character and storytelling, this dark but captivating short animation -- directed by Isabel Peppard from a script she co-wrote with producer Warwick Burton -- offers a fable of creativity, imagination and freedom. Almost steampunk in its hints of Victoriana, the grit and grime of the visuals capture the squalor of poverty and the grind of work, both of which the young heroine must navigate in her quest to find self-expression.\n\nThe 3-D stop-motion and puppet animation are doll-like, but it eschews the cute and charming for the macabre, eccentric and peculiar. Its world-building is highly evocative and the visuals have an eccentricity that would appeal to fans of Tim Burton, but the writing and storytelling have the classicism of a fairy tale, with emotional clarity and evenness in the pacing. Though the creative flourishes of Claire's art -- and the film itself -- verge on the surreal, there's still a spirit of gentle innocence at the heart of the tale that's highly approachable and relatable.\n\nLike many heroines in fairy tales, Claire -- who is voiced beautifully by Academy Award-nominated actor Rachel Griffiths -- finds herself in a difficult bind and must rely on her wits and strength to get herself out. Before that can happen, though, she must learn to believe in herself and remind herself of her inner truth and light. In doing so, she gains a power that propels her into an action-packed climax that has her fighting for her freedom and liberation.\n\n\"Butterflies\" is a fantastical, dark and bewitching storytelling experience, and its striking visuals offer an emotional and instinctive way of experiencing the narrative. But despite its otherworldly look and feel, it also speaks to the ordinary existential horror of dimming our light in a life of obligation and conformity. Most of us strive for a life full of meaning and purpose, but life often pulls us away from our paths. While dreams may not be fulfilled in the way we expect, losing sight of them can create a dull, even hopeless existence. Part of the work of adulthood is learning to nurture these colorful, fragile dreams, and realize it may be enough to have them in the first place.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But they lead very different lives, though they live in the same home. Nouchka is a star gymnast, whose career is nurtured by their domineering Russian mother, who projects her own aspirations onto her talented daughter. Velika, however, works at a pool and spa store and is ignored.\n\nThe sisters were once close but have diverged emotionally. But one fateful day, both of their careers take an unexpected turn, changing the dynamic of the family.\n\nDirected by Alyssa McClelland from a script she co-wrote with Simone Moessinger, this deadpan, intelligently calibrated short dramedy is a portrait of a dysfunctional family that achieves a complex, unique tone and mordant humor with its remarkable images and committed vision.\n\nWhat's most striking initially about the film is its distinctive visual approach, which emphasizes artful, striking but often static wide shots. Within the frame, characters move in and out of spaces exuberantly festooned with decoration, and color in the sets and costumes is cleverly employed to keep the eye moving. But despite the almost fanciful use of color and volume of the film's physical world, the wide shots create a sense of emotional aridity and isolation, as does the spare dialogue, with little interaction or relating between characters. Each character is off in their world, and these worlds rarely intersect.\n\nFunny little details catch the eye and build character and milieu, but the overall impression is distant and absurdist, as if watching strange specimens go about their existence with their odd rituals and preoccupations. Such a distance can often skew cold, but as the spare but meticulous storytelling focuses on Velika, her character and the challenges she faces become clearer and the narrative begins to engage emotionally.\n\nThe challenge for Velika -- and the whole family, really -- comes in the form of her overbearing mother, who completely neglects Velika and her husband in favor of Nouchka. The film applies a spiky, almost satirical lens of humor to its observations of a stage mom/coach with her young protege. But as the film unfolds, viewers realize how lonely Velika and the rest of the family is.\n\nThe performances here generally follow the almost mannerist approach of the visuals and are muted and deadpan. But flickers of genuine emotion, especially from actors Karina and Raechelle Banno, who play the twins, hint at the reservoir of sadness underneath everything. These deeper feelings come to the fore when Velika and her twin's fortunes change one day, changing their family as a result.\n\n\"Second Best\" is deeply and darkly funny, but its humor is of a very dry, ironical vein. It's a necessary distance, for if the film took a more naturalistic, straightforward approach to the portrayal of the family, it would be a tragedy to watch. Instead, we're allowed to laugh at the absurdities of the human ego and watch their ripple effect on a family quietly enduring its dysfunction.\n\nIn the end, though, there's a gentle twist, and we're rewarded with a scene of genuine rapprochement and connection. It reminds us of the connection that was lost for these twin sisters, but also what is restored when they assert themselves and stand up for themselves and their bond, despite everything.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

That neighborhood is gentrifying quickly, and she feels a bit guilty about it.\n\nLooking to alleviate her guilt, she tries to befriend Inder, the Indian woman who works at her corner bodega. She chats up the Inder incessantly, attempting to bond with her over everything from her jewelry to questions about her background, but Emma's efforts are on the aggressive side. As they escalate and Inder remains unmoved, Emma barrels into a confrontation with her privilege, and a spiral into anxiety at the same time.\n\nWritten and directed by Nicholas Colia, this perceptive, intelligent short comedy of manners -- which is produced by Maria Altamirano and Kate Stahl -- offers sharp, funny observations about how social upheavals and uncertainties play out in our everyday interactions. This terrain has been well-established by filmmakers as diverse as Woody Allen, Sofia Coppola, Christopher Guest and many more, but the short injects contemporary issues into the genre, with witty, smart and empathetic results.\n\nIts humor pokes some fun at the milieu of the upwardly mobile (and apparently artisanal cheese-obsessed) white professional, who historically have moved into established urban enclaves and driven up housing prices. But the engine of the narrative is grounded in character, particularly in Emma's well-meaning attempts to befriend Inder, which are often humorously flustered and anxious as she tries to prove she's not just a yuppie taking over a neighborhood.\n\nThe writing is excellent, capturing the many considerations that people must navigate when talking about issues like race, immigration and other hot button topics. And they're wonderfully played for comedy, as Emma digs herself into deeper and deeper holes with Inder as she tries to prove she's understanding of issues that Inder possibly faces. A relaxed but almost forensic visual style captures Emma's social dynamic, emphasizing sometimes awkward framing and tight close-ups that feel almost claustrophobic at times. But the camerawork -- helmed by cinematographer Jomo Fray -- helps viewers understand Emma's rising anxiety, especially as Inder (played by actor Gita Reddy with a perfect deadpan) remains stony-faced in the face of Emma's charm offensive.\n\nActor Christy Escobar plays Emma with a deft balance of grounded emotion and comic timing, and displays a great fluency with the quicksilver dialogue. Emma is portrayed with a soupcon of satire, but still emerges with dimensionality because she is so genuine, well-meaning and vulnerable. Her Emma is funny because she tries so hard to relate to Inder. But she relates to Inder as a social type, or a representative of an idea or category. When Emma finally relates to Inder as a human being, with humor and authenticity, they can finally connect, in a final scene that is both quite touching and hilarious at the same time.\n\nAn award winner at both Cleveland and Palm Springs, \"Untitled Short Film About White People\" was made in 2018, just as social movements of all kinds began to take over the news and social media feeds. The storytelling has a lightness of touch, which makes its ability to reflect and examine the issue of social guilt all the more accomplished and dextrous. It appreciates how Emma is so willing to \"go there\" while still gently poking fun at how she goes about it. And in the end, it achieves one final zinger of a joke, while still evoking real feelings of warmth and goodwill for its resolute humanity.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But Sharon must dig deep when the most isolated of her students, Bear, needs her the most.\n\nWritten and directed by Native American filmmaker Erica Tremblay, this short drama -- which was a selection at Sundance in 2020 -- is a thoughtful, resonant portrait of a relationship between a teacher and student. Offering a snapshot of modern Native American life, it gently captures its strained economic poverty, but it's also a quietly moving story of what it truly means to make a difference in a young person's life.\n\n\"Making a difference\" is a theme that's often the stuff of tidy, didactic \"Movie of the Week\" stories. But the visuals have the feel of an observational documentary and pay intimate, non-judgmental attention to the characters and their world. Pared-down images and an austere naturalism are deployed with great thought and intelligence to put us in the headspace of its strained, weary teacher.\n\nThe storytelling and writing are equally as spare, with brief, laconic dialogue and close attention paid to gestures and silence. Sharon's detachment and exhaustion with her students are presented with a certain matter-of-fact understanding, and the story's small, ordinary moments are rich with finely observed details.\n\nIn such a spare, almost austere film, performances become an important point of connection for an audience, even as they exist in such a quiet artistic approach. Actor Lily Gladstone plays Sharon with extraordinary honesty and restraint, and isn't afraid to show how embattled and almost rote-like someone can feel in the tiring, draining everyday battles of a teacher trying to do a thankless job with very little support or resources. But when her most challenged student hits a breaking point, she gets a reminder of just how important she is to her students.\n\nBuilding off the director's experiences of growing up in Oklahoma with her Native schoolteacher mother, \"Little Chief\" is an exploration of modern Native American life. It's also a tribute to the resilience of teachers, who do a job many say is important, but are rarely provided with resources, power or even appreciation.\n\nTheir intrepid commitment in the face of sometimes overwhelming odds is captured here with an unsentimental, unvarnished story of great subtlety and beauty -- one that refuses cheap and easy heroism, instead showing what it means to show up, day after day, in the face of grim realities.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They attempt to hang out, dancing around what they want to say -- until their real feelings inevitably bubble to the surface, exposing the hurt and misunderstandings that absence hasn't softened.\n\nThis short romantic dramedy -- co-written by stars Lola Blanc and Kenny Lucas, and directed by Blanc -- is a charming film about a bittersweet situation, as two former lovers navigate a tricky transition out of the hopes and dreams of romance into an uneasy truce. Set over the course of an evening, the usually gleaming look of romance films is darker and more saturated than usual, hinting at the moodier themes of the narrative.\n\nThe dexterous, witty writing's humor and sharp emotional observations come from the use of subtitles, which flash each character's real feelings and thoughts as they talk. It's a gambit we've seen in classic films like \"Annie Hall,\" but applied here in a rawer, more emotionally direct way. The conceit is very funny and relatable, and the comedy cleverly comes from the gap between what's pretended on the surface and the rawness and vulnerability of the emotions underneath.\n\nBlanc and Lucas have a back-and-forth that feels lived-in, familiar and even affectionate, and it's easy to believe them as a couple with a simpatico sense of intelligence, interests and humor. But as their conversation escalates -- and their feelings can't so easily be disguised -- viewers get a glimpse of the larger conflicts and rough edges that likely brought their romance to an end. The easygoing comedy shifts into a more melancholic register, as the subtitles express the real anguish and hurt that the pair have not quite gotten over. They still are bewildered about why two seemingly compatible people did not quite work out romantically, and even when they negotiate a ceasefire after their verbal dust-up, the question still hangs over them.\n\n\"In Other Words\" is a sharp, funny snapshot about the vagaries of love and communication, even when the romance has come to an end. It uses a clever conceit to illuminate the gap between the words we say and the emotions we feel, showing how we can use words to protect and insulate ourselves from deep emotional pain. \"Communication is key\" is a trope of supposedly good emotional advice, but it's much harder and trickier to put into practice, especially when words can be weapons and it's easy to dissemble about our real thoughts and feelings. That's the small but poignant tragedy in a broken romance sometimes. We can riff and banter about any number of topics with the people we love. But when it comes to speaking from the heart, we have a hard time hearing each other -- even when we're often saying the same thing.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As they drive, they talk and seem to enjoy one another's company.\n\nBut on a detour to get some ice cream in addition to their Thai food, Ben delivers some news that doesn't sit well with Andi. She is forced to face the reality of their situation and must either speak up for herself or lose the relationship.\n\nThis short relationship drama -- directed by Lauren Simpson and written by co-stars Haley Rawson and Taylor Miller, who play Andi and Ben, respectively -- is a \"snapshot\" kind of film, capturing a conversation between two people in a car on one seemingly ordinary night. It begins almost like a typical romance, but as the film progresses, it gives voice to a deeper melancholy and anger underlying its low-key appearances of amiability.\n\nNarrow and focused in its narrative scope, the film possesses a muted, darkly naturalistic visual style that adds to the offhand, casual atmosphere of the film, along with the warm banter between the couple at the story's beginnings. This relaxed, \"chill\" look is echoed in Andi's demeanor, especially since the couple enjoys each other's company, and actors/co-writers Rawson and Miller have terrific rapport. Ben compliments Andi on being a cool girl, which is something she seems to appreciate.\n\nYet that persona begins to crack a little, as Ben reveals that their viewpoints on their shared romantic situation are further apart than Andi thought. The dialogue and performance travel this terrain with great perceptiveness, tracing a schism that grows into a chasm as details fall into place. Andi and Ben begin the story aligned and seemingly on the same page -- at least, in Andi's eyes. But then she realizes that appearances are not what they seem, and how she chooses to address that gap is the crux of the film's drama.\n\nAt this point, the craftsmanship also unfurls a more meditative and sophisticated series of strategies to put us in Andi's subjectivity. Especially smart use of sound and a shift in camerawork capture Andi's disassociation as Ben begins to \"spin\" the situation, and she gets distracted by the sight of another couple having a heated, almost violent argument nearby.\n\nThe juxtaposition seems to set off an internal revelation for Andi, and forces her to see -- and maybe address -- her true thoughts to Ben. Rawson here especially captures this troubling moment with precision and thoughtfulness, and she delivers a pointed, powerful statement to Ben -- one that may be relatable and perhaps empowering to many.\n\nMore subversive than it initially seems, \"Drive-Thru\" doesn't let the audience, or Andi, have such an easy release valve. Its ending could be read as a twist on the page, but in the end, it sadly feels all too realistic, especially in a world where stifling our voices to find love, acceptance and belonging can be par for the course. Ultimately, \"Drive-Thru\" achieves an unsettling resonance, by bringing to life both the twisted games that make up modern dating, and the silencing of needs to fulfill both societal pressures and our longings for love. The price of that silence, though, is in how small and unworthy we feel, and how little we gain for it.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Their parents of the Castellano family have passed away, and the rest of the group wants to maintain family traditions in the face of their loss.\n\nBut when Don confesses a secret that puts him at odds with his family, all hell breaks loose -- and the volume around the dinner table rises in the face of a revelation that goes so far against the family traditions. As the family bickers, they see Don's secret as a betrayal of their parents' legacy.\n\nWarmhearted and expressive, this short family dramedy -- directed by Kevin Mead and written by Don Fanelli -- puts viewers at the center of a gathering of a large, garrulous clan, giving us a close-range POV of the different, and often competing, personalities. These psychological fault-lines are often smoothed over or ignored in favor of togetherness and belonging, but one of their differences comes to the fore, chaos erupts... loudly.\n\nWith its compressed, intimate location and narrative scope -- essentially one evening meal in one place -- the writing and performances do much of the heavy lifting in the storytelling, though the clean, polished visuals situate us clearly, helping viewers get their bearings within this large gathering. The dialogue expertly captures the tenor of the family, and these siblings talk to one another in a boisterous, lively way.\n\nThere's no doubt there is a lot of love in the family, but each member is not afraid to give each other a hard time and stand up for their viewpoints, and much of the humor is found in their give-and-take. The dialogue feels free-wheeling and true to life, but structurally, it takes great care to give each character a distinctive role and perspective.\n\nThe ensemble cast brings the Castellanos to life, with each performer balancing their distinctive personality with the way that families echo and influence one another's mannerisms, rhythms and body language. Viewers will easily believe this is a real family, and the effort pays off when one of the flock reveals a decision that differs drastically from how they've grown up -- and the differences flare up into drama with a capital D.\n\nIn a time of social distancing and changes wrought by a global pandemic, \"Sunday Dinner\" has an unexpected resonance, especially now that many of us more keenly appreciate what it means to gather and commune over food, drink and conversation with our loved ones.\n\nThere's nothing flashy in the craftsmanship, but its quiet excellence allows for viewers to feel like unofficial members of the family, with a seat at the table. We feel the warmth of belonging, and also understand the unique role of gathering in creating this sense of connection. Like Don, we feel tension and anxiety at the idea of doing something that can threaten that bond. But we also learn that true belonging doesn't require making ourselves smaller or invisible, but thrives when we're at our most authentic and honest with the people we love.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He lives in a trailer with his extended family, including his bedridden mother wasting away from an unspecified illness.\n\nTimo's life is a quiet one, especially during the cold, bleak offseason when no one goes to the fairgrounds. But just on the verge of the park reopening, Timo's mother passes away, and the young boy and his family must pass the hardest winter of their lives as they deal with their loss.\n\nThis Oscar-longlisted short drama -- directed and co-written by Giulio Mastromauro, with co-writer Andrea Brusa -- is a humble, poetic portrait of grief, as well as a unique childhood spent among an equally singular community.\n\nIt is a profoundly quiet film, with spare dialogue and very little musical score in the first half of the film. But the visuals are richly evocative, filled with textures and thoughtfulness. Like a child whose attention is fascinated by the smallest detail, the camera captures the sights and sounds that comprise Timo's ramshackle world, and the gestures and expressions of the grown-ups around him, which seems perhaps grimmer than usual.\n\nRendered in melancholic lighting, muted colors and a slower, meditative editing pace, a snapshot of a world emerges. A quiet but deep sorrow suffuses the silences and spaces both out in the park and within Timo's home, and the young child is not quite sure what to make of it. The family already faces poverty, despite their hard work and efforts. But the illness of Timo's mother casts a much more troubling shadow over everything, though no one has told him just how sick she is.\n\nThe elongated storytelling and profound quiet of the film's first half ripen into an extraordinarily poignant second half, as Timo finally understands his mother will not get better. And in fact, she passes away, sending the family to a crisis point. The community offers its condolences, in a lovely scene that captures the simple but moving way they honor the family's loss and offer consolation. But the loss is still heartbreaking and profoundly isolating, especially for Timo, whose father is unmoored in his raging grief.\n\nWith a beautifully understated performance, young actor Christian Petaroscia is remarkable as Timo and captures his watchfulness, curiosity and growing bewilderment as the storytelling progresses. He says very little in the film, but his face and expressions are so open and responsive that simply watching him is compelling. When Timo breaks open in grief, the moment's honesty and authenticity is an expression of the pain borne by the deepest of grief, and absolutely heartbreaking to watch.\n\n\"Timo's Winter\" is based on a true story, and the film's epigraph both hints at the inspiration and offers a final, touching moment of grace in a film that emerges profoundly poetic at its conclusion. In its avoidance of melodrama and its courage to let simple yet elegant images speak volumes, it achieves a genuine sense of tragedy. It is a hushed but honest portrayal of a hard loss for a family already facing hard times, and its muteness in the face of unspeakable grief is eloquent and heartrending.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Both women are ogling men they aim to take home for the night, though Abby is difficult to please because most men there seem too young for the 30-something adjunct professor.\n\nBut when Olivia connects with someone at the bar, leaving Abby at loose ends, Abby decides to barrel forward with a young prospect named Tyler, who seems interested. But she has an unexpected connection to Tyler, leaving Abby to confront just how hard \"adulting\" can be.\n\nWritten and directed by Kevin P. Alexander, this sly comedy starts as a gritty, sexy urban drama, with shadowy, hazily sexy visuals capturing two women on the prowl at a bar and evaluating potential hookups around them. Their banter is both brittle and barbed, with a worldly cynicism and flinty intelligence not unfamiliar to the archetype of a free, independent woman living in the city. The narrative seems to be one of modern sexual freedom and liberation, complete with a drink at the bar and promising a cigarette after sex.\n\nBut the excellent writing weaves in a few details that skew the story and its expectations ever so slightly from this initial narrative path. In doing so, it gives a millennial twist to the \"woman in the city\" trope, mining the distance between archetype and Abby's reality for comedic gold. To give away some of the specific details would deflate some of the surprise, but suffice it to say that the story segues in a delightfully stealthy way into screwball situational comedy, and the transition is both seamless and a delightful surprise.\n\nActors Maren Lord and Christopher Dylan White as Abby and Tyler navigate the transition into comedy with great skill, and both remain grounded in their characters' emotional realities in both halves of the story. The second half is a \"morning after\" unlike any other, with one surprise after another, as Abby must confront her inability to \"adult\" in the cold light of morning.\n\n\"Boys and Toys\" plays at an urban sophistication, but like many comedies, it undercuts that facade, unearthing the vulnerable reality that such a persona protects. In the end, the story emerges with a sense of great fun, and the farce is handled with a nimble lightness that stays true to character and situation. The joke is that Abby puts in much effort to hide her difficulties in achieving success as a grown-up. But she discovers, with great irony, that we can't quite distance ourselves from our formative years, no matter how hard we try to pretend otherwise.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She lost one of her hands at an earlier age to the predations of a witch doctor named Natron, who mutilated her for his potions.\n\nMansa has had to live with the aftereffects of the violence, neglecting her work as a teacher and her role in the community. She is consumed with the idea of getting back at the man who treated her so inhumanely. She enlists her father to pose as a potential client to Natron, luring the witch doctor out of his home, where she can exact her revenge.\n\nWritten and directed by Luke Bradford, this Oscar-longlisted short thriller offers a propulsive, dynamic take on the plights of individuals with albinism in many African countries, who are believed by witch doctors to have magical properties and who hunt people with albinism down, mutilating them. It generates compelling suspense in following the plight of Mansa, who seeks revenge on the witch doctor and gets inside the headspace of someone traumatized by violence, who can't seem to shake its aftereffect.\n\nThe subject matter will be difficult and shocking to many, and through its energetic pace and vivid, dazzling visuals, the film offers a visceral and powerful way to enter into the issue and tap into the profound injustice of it all. We also get glimpses of the albinism community, and the way they must band together to feel accepted and safe -- and are set apart from mainstream life.\n\nThe narrative covers a lot of ground, needing to quickly establish the cultural context, relationships and characters. It crams a feature's worth of events into the short format, juggling many story elements, though it takes more time in a slightly slower, more internal middle section exploring Mansa's trauma and the way that resentment has twisted her emotions. \n\nActor Refilwe Modiselle's performance captures how the inhumanity she faced has scarred her, twisting her emotions into a bitter resentment and rage at what happened to her. But actor Aubrey Mmakola's performance as the witch doctor Natron captures the true horror of the plight of Mansa and others with albinism. Natron looks at Mansa in their re-encounter and sees nothing but a commodity, and the matter-of-factness of his dehumanization of her is chilling, pushing Mansa to the brink in an explosive climax.\n\nIt's tempting to think of the idea of mutilating people with albinism as savage, superstitious and barbaric, and not go deeper into why such practices persist in the cultures that hold these beliefs. But \"White Gold\" has a slight twist at its conclusion, one that offers some subtle commentary on why these beliefs persist. In some ways, the ending is even more disturbing than it appears at first because it demonstrates how deeply embedded such ideas are into the social fabric, and how poverty and a lack of options contribute to their endurance, despite education, morality or notions of human decency. The injustice at the heart of \"White Gold\" is clear, but the solution will be much more complicated to put in place.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He's also a busy single parent who can't seem to get a break from his rambunctious kids, an angel and devil who are always fighting and baby Jesus screaming in the background.\n\nOne particular day when the kids are acting up and melting down, he's too busy to pay attention to his computer, and the cosmos goes slightly awry -- leading to a creation of a very different world as we know it.\n\nThis fun, rollicking animated short -- made by the team at acclaimed Danish animation house Tumblehead -- is a unique \"alternate world\" take on the story of creation, imagining the \"great creator\" in a new way that's likely highly relatable in the age of pandemic parenting, though the was made before the global onset of COVID-19. With great wit and an almost acrobatic sense of invention, it hops, skips and wiggles around the cosmos, imagining the comedic mayhem that results when the loose ends of creation are left dangling.\n\nPortrayed in a mix of 2D and 3D animation, the scale of the storytelling is vast, as the distracted half-made adjustments by God play out throughout the universe. Dinosaurs, people and other creatures evolve in unexpected ways, which play out over a wide-ranging tapestry of time and space. Adam -- the original man -- in particular has an eventful, consequential run-in with an alien, with amusing consequences.\n\nLike many animated shorts, it takes advantage of the imaginative possibilities of the medium to cram the 7-minute runtime with gags, jokes and flourishes of whimsy, starting with the creation of a universe by a computer program called Multiverse, which vaguely resembles an old program of Windows. It's funny to imagine that the whole of the cosmos can be compressed into one app, but with the vagaries of technology, it also means that mistakes can propagate much faster and much more widely.\n\nIn order to scale such breadth in terms of story and scope, the pacing is lightning-fast, giving the story's events a zaniness that resembles slapstick and farce, as well as the great cartoons of the 1950s. It gives the film a particularly family-friendly feeling, though there's plenty of subversive jokes in the action that grown-ups will appreciate, with details and cues that point to various conspiracy theories and religious references. This wealth of detail all snowballs to hilarious effect, until God himself finally gets a break from parenting emergencies to notice the warning on his computer, and the chaos it has wrought in his creation.\n\nAs a funny riff on the notion of worldbuilding and perhaps even the idea of \"doing it all\" as a parent, \"Tales From the Multiverse\" is a skewed take on creation and the origins of the universe. Its central conceit could easily be stretched and explored in different directions for a larger project, and it's fun to imagine all the different ways the multiverse could morph -- and imagine God as the ultimate parent, trying to balance home and job duties like so many other moms and dads working from home, and trying to keep his sanity in the process.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As longtime friends, they've known each other since childhood, but from the way they're dressed, their styles have diverged. And so have their lives: Issac has a white-collar job and is now buying a house in East London, while Jude has remained in their neighborhood, dealing drugs and struggling to try to keep a family together.\n\nJoking and friendly, warmth and affection still flow between the two men. But as they catch up, they wrangle over questions of staying in the community, leaving friends behind and what it means to be successful in life. As they finally have dinner together, their paths may be taking them farther apart.\n\nWriter-director Abraham Adeyemi's Oscar-longlisted short drama is a fraught but affectionate portrait of a lifelong friendship between two men, now at a crossroads in life as they face shattered dreams, hard-won successes and changing lives. Told as a two-hander interwoven with flashbacks to when they were boys, the narrative generates both melancholy and warmth in tracing how currents of love and resentment flow between the two friends as they grapple with the questions of home, loyalty and community.\n\nThe backbone of a two-hander is often the double helix of writing and performance. Both are solidly accomplished here, with a sharp, concise way of limning character and values through dialogue. The characters easily slip back and forth between the Jamaican and more straight-laced English, but the dialogue also contracts and expands the psychological distance between Isaac and Jude as they talk. This back-and-forth guides the intimate, handheld camerawork, visual naturalism and editing capturing the South London milieu that functions as a looming influence over Isaac and Jude.\n\nThe use of flashback in such an intimate format can sometimes be jarring in shorts, but it works effectively here to offer a contrast between the boys who are more simpatico in style and sensibility, and the men they've become, who make radically different choices from one another. Both sets of actors playing their pair -- Ivanno Jeremiah and Parys Jordon as adult Isaac and Jude, and Joshua Camera and Tyrus Mckenzie as their boyhood counterparts -- have ease and naturalness, as well as understated precision in hinting at the differences and tensions navigated by the characters. Those tensions never quite come to a head, but there is an underlying sadness for both viewers and characters in realizing that these friends may be slowly drifting apart, as their journeys and choices in life take them in opposite directions.\n\nA prize-winner at Tribeca, \"No More Wings\" has an unpretentious, worn-in and authentic modesty in its look and feel. But the story is rich in feeling and thoughtful in exploring the sociocultural tensions it gives voice to, and in the end, its emotional impact feels much bigger and more panoramic than initially hinted.\n\nThe dilemma of staying true to the community while rising higher in life is a tension often navigated in many neighborhoods, especially as they rapidly gentrify. But what \"No More Wings\" accomplishes with compelling grace and thoughtfulness is showing how the boisterous warmth and sometimes demanding pull of community lives within us, casting a long, keenly felt influence -- one that feels like both a shadow and embrace, often at the same time.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The ship is arranged just like his favorite room on Earth, even down to the smallest dust particle, according to the robot. But the man is anxious to leave the ship for a bigger life. Together, they travel throughout the galaxy searching for a new habitable planet, since Earth has become uninhabitable.\n\nThe robot, however, is sworn to keep humans from coming to harm. Every alternative planet discovered is not good enough for the man to live, according to the robot. But the man is tired of being stuck on the ship, no matter how comfortable it is. Desperate to leave, he rebels against his robot -- only to discover just how seriously the machine takes its charge to protect the man, even from himself.\n\nThis visionary short animation -- written, directed and created by Turkish director Gokalp Gonen -- opens with Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. Robots must not allow humans to come to harm, must protect their existence, and do not have to follow orders that would conflict with these directives. Asimov's rules have been the springboard for many other sci-fi stories. But rarely have they been explored with such sumptuous sense of visuals or flair for evocative atmospherics that makes for a genuinely mesmerizing cinematic experience.\n\nIn a genre where either pristine minimalism or Victorian-influenced steampunk reign as the dominant visual style, the beautifully baroque and ornate art of \"Avarya\" stands out. The ship's room has a rich, textured look reminiscent of Art Deco, with its books and antique furniture full of decorative flourishes. It could be any well-appointed library anywhere, but for the view of the space and planets outside the room.\n\nBut the film's distinctive aesthetic is encapsulated in the singular look and feel of the robot, notable for its peacock-like \"crown\" or headdress, which flares in and out as it calculates and communicates with its charge. Combined with its cape-like torso, the robot evokes a courtier or seneschal in a foreign imperial court and all the obsequiousness and subterfuge it evokes.\n\nThe robot is the other half of what's essentially a two-hander in the storytelling, and emerges as the primary obstacle for the man, who is beset with dreams and visions of the outside world. Though the pacing is meditative, enveloping viewers instead of pulling them along, the film never ceases to enchant the eye and evoke the sense of a darker mystery at work: the true nature of the robot and its mission, which has evolved from its original directive into something more sinister. In doing so, it has created a whole world -- one that becomes almost claustrophobic in its opulence and inhumane in its self-contained isolation.\n\nAs a beautiful puzzle-box of a story, \"Avarya\" is so packed with symbolism and ideas, with a core of enigmatic thought and feeling that requires multiple viewings to fully appreciate. Though its basic narrative through-line is simple enough to grasp when first watched, the storytelling works on a dreamlike, subconscious level -- much like it does for the main character -- with motifs and images that repeat with suggestive potential. And like a dream, the shape-shifting of visions can reassure or inspire us to keep striving for the larger impulses for home or truth. Or, if left unsatisfied, they can eventually turn terrifying in their ability to haunt us.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They were tall, and deep in voice, yet had gently soft-spoken demeanors. They were strangers but quickly grew beloved by the local population for their prowess at healing, which was prodigious, due to their ability to access both their masculine and feminine sides within themselves.\n\nIn tribute to the visitors, the village erects four healing stones on Waikiki Beach, known now as the Wizard Stones, which the healers imbued with their spirit. But as time marches on, the power of the stones, as well as the ambiguous identities of the healers they honored, become hidden, even covered by a bowling alley at one point. And as the healers' status as both male and female is erased, the power of the stones recedes as well, forgotten or oversimplified by the modern world.\n\nThis mythic, gorgeously conceived Oscar-shortlisted animation -- written and directed by Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, Dean Hamer and Joe Wilson, with director of animation Daniel Sousa -- may be short in format, but its sweep is epic in feel, bringing to life a powerful legend with a compelling authenticity and rich storytelling. Relayed in the language of Olelo Niihau, a rare dialect of Hawaiian spoken before Western contact, the story captures a vein of spiritual wisdom, bringing it back to light and consciousness as an act of love and honor.\n\nThe hand-painted visual style -- developed by Oscar-nominated animation director Daniel Sousa -- has an elemental simplicity in line, combined with rich, earthy colors, sumptuous textures and a sense of movement that dazzles the eye and imagination. Layered and intricate, the images reflect the heritage, flora and fauna of Hawaii with stately elegance. And when combined with an evocative sound design, beautiful musical score and compelling voiceover, it makes for a stunning achievement in cinematic craftsmanship and a feast for the eyes.\n\nBut the real innovation is found in the narrative, which functions in the register of legends and myths, told in the Hawaiian story tradition that it originated within and retaining the values of acceptance that underlie the culture. This version of \"Kapaemahu\" restores the full identity of Kapaemahu and the other healers, which treats categories like gender in a more fluid, even gentler way -- and without the rigidity, shame or denial that Westernizations have brought to the tale.\n\nThe story of the healers in \"Kapaemahu\" can be read in an archetypal way, as befitting a myth or legend. But it also makes clear that the ability to draw on the ability of the mahus to draw on their inner male and inner female is the source of their power as healers, teachers and leaders. In the end, restoring this authenticity not only honors the healers, but honors fluidity as an asset that allows all of us to access our full power. In the ability to embrace all aspects of themselves -- dark and light, feminine and masculine, strong and weak -- we become fuller, more empowered people, with the full spectrum of humanity available within us.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

To make more space, they are offloading the books about people whose lives are not that interesting. Knut-Robby's is one of those wasted, boring lives. But Knut-Robby disagrees and tries to prove that he's worthy of inclusion.\n\nWriter-director Stian Hafstad's whimsical, sharp-witted short comedy has a clever and fanciful premise, but outside of a few charmingly offhand special effects, it executes its idea in a mostly naturalistic way. Instead of getting caught up in the how and why of the library, the narrative uses the idea to explore what it means to live a purposeful life -- and how we react when confronted with the meaninglessness of it all.\n\nConfronting the existential dilemmas of life is a heavy subject, but the film's style and writing offer plenty of levity and wit. Touches of eccentricity and flamboyance pop up in the craftsmanship, from the mockingly serious voiceover to the exalted choral score to the dynamic camerawork and halo-like lighting during certain moments. Though Knut-Robby's existential crisis is serious, the film treats it with a light touch, using it as a vehicle for some hilarious zingers and a conduit to explore his scrambling desperate reaction at being judged as too meaningless for eternity.\n\nThroughout the film, other people get similar news to Knut-Robby, with different reactions that reveal a range of philosophical positions. One woman finds it a relief to exist without the pressure of making life matter; another has a drastic, angry reaction against God. Knut-Robby's methods to get back into the library reflect his immaturity, but also his sense of fun and enjoyment, as played with great comic timing and charm by actor Peter Forde. The moment when he realizes his life is truly meaningless is played for sincerity, and Knut-Robby is genuinely distressed that his time on earth has seemingly been wasted. But then he gets an unexpected boost and embraces challenge in a way that's true for him.\n\n\"Library of God\" is a tricky balancing act, blending comedy and philosophy in a way similar to films by a writer-director like David O. Russell, whose tragicomic characters grapple with serious issues in often darkly humorous way. But instead of being abrasive, this short is witty, amiable and fun to spend time with, much like Knut-Robby himself, who stakes out the right to enjoy life on his terms. He may be slightly more goal-oriented after his existential crisis, but those goals are true to his nature -- which, in the end, is the only foundation to build happiness upon.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But just when something comes through, he finds himself helping out Artie, a deaf-blind man waiting for a bus home.\n\nThe encounter is anything but straightforward, not only due to their differences in abilities but also their different temperaments and ages. But as Tereek helps Artie navigate a ride home, he learns to see the world through another perspective beyond his own -- and broadening his horizons in the process.\n\nWriter-director Doug Roland's Oscar-shortlisted short drama -- executive produced by Marlee Matlin and in partnership with Helen Keller Services -- is a deceptively simple narrative that takes place over one evening between two characters. But this chance encounter -- captured with visual storytelling that's both natural, unforced and still deftly crafted -- uncovers riches of empathy, along with a profound revelation about how people can offer fellowship, help and care to one another, even in the simplest of ways.\n\nWith its themes of connection and empathy, the writing is economical and precise, laying down the story and character beats with pacing and care that keeps the audience interest moving forward while allowing key moments to breathe.\n\nThe power of this kind of humanistic drama rests on the excellent performances that audiences can relate to, and the film succeeds admirably in this department. Robert Tarango -- the first deaf-blind actor to perform in a film -- plays Artie with plenty of warmth, intelligence and humor to draw in Tereek. His character is not just about the difficulty of his difference, though. His deafness and blindness enable a certain way of being in the world, one where he must trust in the world, accepts obstacles and opportunities with equanimity and enjoys the everyday pleasures and people that life gives him. \n\nTereek in turn learns these lessons as well, as he helps Artie with the task of getting to the right bus. Tereek's circumstances are established upfront in subtle but unmistakable ways: he has no home, and he's trying to hide this. As a result, he's guarded and rootless, and while he can joke around with friends, he's not truly carefree, since he's weighed down by anxiety about where he's going to sleep at night. Telling details capture this inner tension: he wolfs down his food while his friends leisurely nibble at it, for example.\n\nActor Steven Prescod's subtle yet precise performance captures Tereek's arc as a young man unmoored, looking out for himself because he has to. And that might cost him his humanity, especially when he snarls at a homeless man visibly less well-off than himself. But as he helps Artie move through the world, he takes on Artie's perspective and becomes his \"brother's keeper,\" opening him up in both feeling and sensibility at a juncture in life where he may close himself off permanently.\n\nOpenhearted and authentic, \"Feeling Through\" was inspired by the director's encounter with a deaf-blind man, which likely inspires the deep sense of tribute and affection that imbues the storytelling with its warmth and sympathy. In a world and time in history more isolated than ever, this heartfelt short has an unexpected resonance, reminding us of a simple yet profound truth that we sometimes are in danger of forgetting. We are here to help and hear one another, to feel more and see beyond ourselves. In doing so, we enlarge the scope of our lives, widen our horizons and expand our hearts.\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Almost despite herself, Leonie begins to care for Udo, investing herself emotionally with his safety and well-being. Through caring for Udo, she begins to confront some of her own painful losses in her past, cracking open her defensive shell and letting other people in.\n\nWith its subject matter and emphasis on emotions, it would be easy for the story to turn sentimental and melodramatic. But the approach of the film hews towards a gentle, elegant restraint, in both the writing and visuals. The camera, for instance, often chooses to play scenes in wide shots that slowly push in towards the action, and the score is plaintive yet minimal in presence, underscoring key moments without overwhelming the film.\n\nThe writing, too, is patient, slowly revealing key details and information that illuminate both Udo and Leonie's pasts. Like real life, viewers take time to gain intimacy with Leonie and Udo, but at the end find themselves rewarded with a deeply moving emotional journey.\n\nWith its emphasis on patience and observation, the film then rests on performances to convey the swirling currents of emotion and realizations that bubble under the action. What's wonderful about Williams's performance is how it leverages aspects of her most famous role -- her strength and forthrightness -- but burrows deep underneath the surface to reveal a deep well of sensitivity and vulnerability, which finds a receptive opening with her growing connection with Udo, played with great care and courtliness by Ronald Pickup.\n\nWilliams offers a dynamic, sensitive performance about a woman finally allowing heartbreaking pain to come to the surface, and the arc it travels is both precise and deeply felt. It also establishes Williams as an actress who can illuminate the full spectrum of human emotion, and audiences will come to the end of the short hoping to see her in more roles like Leonie, in stories like \"Stealing Silver,\" which earns genuine emotion through beautifully crafted writing and an understanding of human nature that is heartfelt, compassionate and unafraid of life's inherent difficulties.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Recently separated from her, he feels he's being unfairly kept away from his newborn son Colin. And he's now taking matters into his own hands.\n\nBut when he finally gets his wife on the phone, alliances will shift and feelings will change as new information emerges during the course of the conversation.\n\nDirected by David M. Helman and written by Nathaniel David Shriver, Naysayer features an intense performance by \"Walking Dead\" actor Steven Yeun, who holds the screen on his own with compelling agitation and intensity.\n\nPlaying a father struggling to be a part of his son's life, Yeun brings the initial emotional dilemma of the film to life with conviction, and each story beat adds a layer of complexity to our understanding of him and his motives. He works beautifully off of a voice performance by actress Alanna Masterson, who manages to convey a rich spectrum of feeling and realization without appearing onscreen. Character and situation are rendered through excellent and precise dialogue, which masterfully controls the information available to the viewer, while deepening our engagement with Ian as a character.\n\nVisually, \"Naysayer\" is a road movie, with Ian on the run as he travels through the rich yet desolate desert landscape, a small speck on a vast expanse. The moving landscape adds to the visual dynamism of the short, while also underscoring Ian's isolation and desperation. As the film slowly darkens -- and the sound design ratchets the intensity with a baby's increased wailing in the background -- so does the audience's understanding of what's really going on with Ian.\n\nUsing a gracefully executed, emotionally devastating sleight-of-hand, the final twist is heart-wrenching, both for Ian as he confronts the meaning of his actions and for the audience, who gets the whole picture of what is happening, and why. Revealing itself in the end as an emotional mystery, it begs for a re-watching of the short -- and shows how things are never as they entirely seem, especially in domestic conflicts, though it can be easy to make it seem so.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Frustrated, she walks out as her producer reminds her they have to finish.\n\nJust then, her sister arrives. Samantha had agreed to go to brunch, but she cancels due to the workload. She hasn't slept in days.\n\nHer sister is angry for being flaked on, telling Samantha she can never keep a schedule -- and she's always busy with nothing to show for it.\n\nSamantha decides to take a walk to the park. As she sits on a bench, an odd stranger -- with a bike locked to his leg -- emerge from the bushes.\n\nShe asks if he's okay and they begin to make conversation. When he talks about waking up with a song stuck in his head, she help him out.\n\nThey break out into a song and dance, which reminds her of why she loves to create music. With newfound inspiration, she goes back to the studio to record her song.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She has feelings of ill-boding that plague her, as well as her own existential fears and crises. One day after confession, she ventures into a snowy field to tend to a cow, only to have it vanish in thin air.\n\nDecades later in West Texas in 1989, the cow reappears at a gas station, along with a strangely burning bush near the gas station. The cow is apparently from Ireland, and the fire never goes out, throwing the inhabitants of this small town into a state of befuddlement at the mystery unfolding before them. And when they're invaded by some kind of official unit on the trail of the cow, they realize there just might be something bigger at work -- and an unexpected connection -- beyond their own comprehension.\n\nStarring iconic \"Mean Girls\" and \"Mamma Mia\" actress Amanda Seyfried, this dramatic short by writer-director Eli Powers is about miracles, mystery and magic, achieving a remarkable mastery of tone and mood through stellar craftsmanship and genuine vision.\n\nThough it features captivating images and beautifully subtle performances by both Seyfried and actor Thomas Sadoski, it won't an easy film for audiences used to straightforward stories that resolve into tidy packages. But if viewers can give themselves over to the potent blend of storytelling, imagery, sound and performance, it will reward them with a memorable experience of wry humor and expansive spirit.\n\nThe film has a sense of the spellbinding, which is built foremost through its luminous, arresting imagery. The content of the images themselves is both whimsical and humble, but the quality of light and the precise framing emphasizes an otherworldliness that suffuses the surfaces of the ordinary life portrayed. The visual approach reflects the writing's balance of ethereal grace and human confusion, which persists despite what seems to be a miracle happening in front of their eyes.\n\nThe structure of the storytelling is ambitious in how it traverses time and place, opening up huge narrative questions right at the start of the film's captivating opening sequence. Some of them are answered, but those answers lead to more questions and mysteries. In many ways, it feels like the beguiling opening movement of a feature, which makes sense: Powers and his producers (including Seyfried) intend the short as a proof-of-concept for a larger story. But as a standalone work, it functions almost like a haiku, packing an evocation of hugeness and transcendence within a remarkable economy of elements.\n\n\"Holy Moses\" is, in many ways, a mystical film, in the sense that it is about the mystery, doubt and the unknowability of life, and how we live the questions often without any concrete answers. Singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen once said, \"There is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in.\"\n\nIn many ways, this is a story about spiritual possibility seeping into the fissures of earthbound life, our own human reactions to it, clouded by our preoccupations and concerns -- and the slow recognition of hidden beauty and connections across time and space. The final moments offer a tantalizing reveal that teases at another connection between its two disparate halves, but it also feeds the sense of a strange, lovely magic at work in the world behind worlds -- a mysterious place that endows depth and wonderment to everyday life, and gives grace to the most ordinary of moments.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

When he encounters a stranger who stumbles upon his camp, the ensuing conversation reveals just how isolated Lorne is, and what the psychological costs of such isolation are.\n\nDirector Jesse Leaman -- along with co-writer Taylor Adams -- has crafted a philosophically engaged dramatic short that tackles an intense, heavy subject: the very nature of existence and what it means to be human, confronting both death and loneliness in a brutal world. Shot strictly from the POV of a silent stranger who wanders upon Lorne's encampment, the narrative essentially focuses on a monologue delivered by a troubled, isolated character so removed from other humans that his solitude has indelibly changed his sense of self and others.\n\nThis monologue is delivered by renowned Australian actor and \"L.A. Confidential\" and \"Memento\" star Guy Pearce, who leverages both his innate movie-star screen charisma and his pliable, supple transformative abilities as a character actor, delivering a powerhouse of a performance.\n\nAs the only human presence we see on screen, he commands attention with a strong presence. And as the mercurial Lorne, he penetrates into the character's peculiar, off-kilter psychology, hitting upon a precise mix of aggression, agitation and loneliness. The dynamic characterization is calibrated to be both subtle and illuminating the more he talks, revealing just how his perspective and processing are as gnarled as the woods around him.\n\nWe don't get many glimpses of the world Lorne inhabits, both physically and mentally. But the glimpses we do get are evocative, thanks to the bleakly moody cinematography, with its muted, painterly colors and camerawork. The visuals constantly emphasize both Lorne's aloneness within the wider world, as well as the slightly warped, worn camp he occupies in the bush. The extremes seem to paint as much a picture of Lorne's state of mind as the textured writing, making for an intriguing character piece with just enough world-building to contextualize his isolation.\n\n\"Lorne\" is less a narrative than a snapshot, but it's a portrait that delves deep into thorny, knotty territory. Through its absence of relationships -- we never do see the stranger that Lorne talks to, and perhaps we're meant to doubt that they really exist -- the story asks just how much we need other people to make sense of ourselves, and to give meaning to our lives.\n\nIf Lorne died and no one remembers him or witnessed anything of his existence, what was his life's meaning? The question is as much a Zen koan as it is a philosophical inquiry, and the lack of concrete answers hangs uneasily like the fogs shrouding the landscape that Lorne hides himself within, the indeterminacy haunting both him and the film's viewers.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

From its stately, rhyming narration -- elegantly delivered by Ian McKellan -- to its warm, vibrant cinematography, the film takes an elevated, whimsical storybook aesthetic, equal parts classic Disney and French fabulist Jean-Pierre Jeunet, to spin a tale that is old-fashioned in feel but modern in its emotional intelligence and sensibility.\n\nThis fable -- which was funded through the prestigious emerging talent fund with Creative England and BFI -- begins with a classic framing device of a storybook's pages turning, and the writing continued in its heightened, almost archetypal mode, with its emphasis on verse and other literary flourishes. The score also lends a note of lightness and charm, helping the rhythm of the story amble along nicely.\n\nBut as the narrative develops -- and the pig is revealed to be gay, in a warmly comical sequence -- the fairy tale genre is intelligently subverted, and the story becomes less about a magical pig and just as much about liberating the farmer from his own emotional straitjacket.\n\nThe visual lushness remains, as does the charming narration, but the resonance deepens as the narrative reflects the journey of the farmer, played with ornery magnificence by BATFA-winning English actor David Bradley, renowned for his roles on landmark entertainments like \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films. He shares the screen with BAFTA winners Rebecca Front and Mark Bonnar, who make delightfully comic appearances.\n\nWhat's remarkable, though, is that the film retains its playful tone and feel as it enters more adult territory, rather than taking a turn towards bleak darkness. Though the visual tone and lighting gets moodier at a key point, the story retains its wit, sincerity and humor, even as the farmer contemplates drastic steps after sinking his life savings into a gay pig. The climax is heightened, funny and touching -- and its aftermath is incredibly heartwarming and delightful.\n\nLonglisted for a BAFTA, \"Edmund the Magnificent\" feels like a classic fabulist entertainment, in look, feel and execution. But in the fairy tales of old, good and evil are clearly delineated, and turning points are less about psychological revelation and more about overcoming obstacles to achieve an often fantastical desire, like a handsome prince or a beautiful kingdom. But this modern take imagines the fairy tale ending differently: it's about accepting what life gives you with grace, and allowing it to expand your heart and spirit. The happiness we gain may not look the way we expect, but it's no less sweet or hard-won.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He is also grappling with a terminal illness and will be dead in a few months.\n\nRealizing his time left is quite short, he enlists his tight circle of friends to help him become \"infinite\" \u2014 to live on in some way despite the ending of his life. As they grapple with their feelings of sadness and grief, the group creates a ritual to celebrate Sid and the cornerstones that have made his life so great \u2014 even as he is on the verge of leaving it.\n\nWritten and directed by Connor O'Hara, this affecting short drama may be about death and coming to terms with one's mortality. But this isn't a dour, introspective narrative, with slow pacing and muted, bleached-out visuals. Instead, it possesses great brio, warmth and liveliness, thanks to its deeply affectionate portrayal of friendship, fellowship and spirit in the face of challenge and doubt.\n\nThe storytelling possesses particularly openhearted writing, tangling directly with the difficulties of grief and sorrow as Sid prepares to leave life. The tenor is set with the opening scene, where Sid details the things that have made his life so rich \u2014 family, friends, location, home and love \u2014 and puts forward his plan to commemorate and immortalize his existence. There's great humor and a long-standing sense of connection between all the friends that comprise this tight circle, as well as a wide-ranging set of feelings as each friend comes to terms with Sid's coming passing.\n\nA film that focuses on friendship, solidarity and community rests its success upon an ensemble of great performances, and here it is lead by actor George MacKay, star of Sam Mendes's Oscar-nominated film 1917. MacKay came to fame gaining accolades for his compelling portrayal of a soldier facing extreme situations, and in this short, he faces another extreme situation involving life and death. Though the character and dramatic dilemma are different, the performance is just as richly sensitive, empathetic and deeply human.\n\nThe visuals, too, have a warmth to them, focusing on a mellow-hued naturalism and a lived-in look in the settings. The visual beauty emphasizes the richness and fullness of Sid's short but shining life: the beauty of the natural surroundings he's lived in, the comfort of his home and the fire that will make the sacred objects of Sid's life into a permanent memory in the world. By the time the fire sends the memories of him into the atmosphere to live forever, we understand in an intimate way just what makes life so beautiful and worth celebrating, both for Sid and for our own lives.\n\n\"Infinite\" is a rare film that is unabashed in its tackling of life's sacred transitions, yoking its broadmindedness and heartfelt nature of the main character's own arc. It is straightforward and unafraid of emotion, which is particularly remarkable for a film about friendships between men, and the deep bonds of affection between them.\n\nBut \"Infinite\" avoids sentimentality, mostly because it does not sugarcoat the sadness and sorrow inherent in Sid's situation. He faces it with grace, good humor, deep acceptance and bravery, and helps his friends come to terms with it as well. In many ways, that's what rituals are for: they're not just to memorialize those who are passing -- but to help their spirit live on with those left behind. The ending ritual closes the film on these aching yet hopeful notes, with equal parts exuberance, tenderness and love -- everything that makes life so worthy of celebrating in the first place.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

With her passion and enthusiasm for her work, Lisa is a believer in true love and the dreams of all-consuming romance.\n\nBut Lisa's own life doesn't quite live up to the fantasies she sells. She lives at home with her dissolute father -- and is still in love with her photographer ex-boyfriend Alf, long after their relationship ended.\n\nBut when Alf comes back into town to shoot a campaign for a treatment for varicose veins, she signs her dad up and finds a way back into Alf's circle, hoping to confess her undying love and win her lover's heart back.\n\nDirector Christoph Rainer adroitly blends a charming sense of European whimsy -- think arthouse classic \"Amelie\" with its stylish, romantic-bohemian visuals and touches of cheeky wit -- with an unflinching examination of the beauty and pain of living with intense emotions.\n\nThe film's secret weapon is lead actress Vicky Krieps, now earning acclaim in Paul Thomas Anderson's feature \"Phantom Thread,\" with Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis. She gives an extraordinarily vulnerable, affecting performance, right down to the film's final transcendent moment.\n\nWith its superlative acting, visual sophistication and honest, witty writing, \"Pitter Patter Goes My Heart\" lays bare the raw, uncomfortable emotions underneath the romantic fantasies we imbue love with \u2014 and should be deeply resonant to anyone who's ever loved truly, madly or deeply.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The icon, aware of the effect he's having, swoops into the fray, solving their issues and revealing himself as a man of many talents -- and as heroic as the famous characters he's played.\n\nThe comic short -- directed by Sebastian Stenhoj and written by Harry Chaskin -- possesses a sly, offbeat wit that derives most of its humor from upending expectation and exploring the collision of sensibilities within a fascinatingly hermetic world.\n\nThe film's style is reminiscent of early Jim Jarmusch, not just with its luminous black-and-white cinematography but with its focus on how eccentric personalities co-exist within a self-contained milieu. And also like Jarmusch, the storytelling and style explore the condition of foreignness and being a \"stranger in a strange land\" with intelligence and humor.\n\nThis particular \"strange land,\" though, is celebrity culture in Los Angeles. In a world saturated with pop culture -- and where many people feel intense emotional attachment to worlds, figures and stories that seem more vivid than reality -- our cultural imagination can make existing in everyday life seem odd, strange, flat or simply just boring.\n\nBut in Hollywood, famous actors, musicians and others pop up in places both heightened and banal, mixing the quotidian with the imaginative and creating a unique tension that's productively explored in this short. The subtle, smart writing plays with this central dilemma of today's star system, in which audiences both revel in and are disappointed by the idea that stars are \"just like us.\"\n\nThe joke, of course, is that the Hoff more than lives up to his heroic reputation, saving the proverbial day for most of these bickering, bedeviled characters. Hasselhoff plays himself with subtlety, charm and a disarming self-awareness that's great fun to watch. He just wants to pick up his takeout in peace, but seeing the buzz his presence creates, he deals with each set of character with verve -- and reveals himself to be both more multi-dimensional than anticipated -- and just as amazing as Knight Rider.\n\n\"To Live and Dine In L.A.\" is a self-assured comic gem that's smart and impeccably calibrated to highlight its biggest asset, thanks to sharp writing and supremely stylish visuals. Beyond Hasselhoff himself, what's most surprising about the story is how uncynical and even deeply human it is. It is easy to drift through the world, sealed off in our own bubble and unaware of the other small worlds in our vicinity -- but it takes a hero like David Hasselhoff to look up from our self-absorption and make us aware of strange charm and wonder around us.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

To escape his troubles, he's fashioned himself a makeshift hideaway on the rooftop of a building, where he camps out and eludes the poverty and violence on the streets below, as well as the local bully Darren.\n\nBut then Darren's girlfriend Trish -- played by Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams in one of her earlier roles -- joins Marcus on his roof. Looking for help, she becomes part of the quiet haven, and Marcus has always nursed a crush on her. But her presence draws in Darren, which threatens not just his private world, but his own safety.\n\nDirected and produced by Nour Wazzi from a script by Anthony Attah, this gritty dramatic short is about a boy who gets a chance to grow closer to the girl he's been pining for. But it's also carving out a space for one's self in a hostile world, and what one will do to stand up and defend it.\n\nStructurally, it starts out on the roofs, taking time to construct Marcus's world and character with a sense of reverie and poetry. Only as the film proceeds does it reveal just how difficult Marcus's life is, with a growing sense of isolation and claustrophobia. We see the poverty he lives in, and the only familial presence in his life, his elderly grandfather, played by veteran British actor and CBE Earl Cameron.\n\nBeyond the presence of Williams -- who went on to gain prominence as the iconic warrior Arya Stark on Game of Thrones -- the film is notable for its visual dynamism, capturing the coiled energy of Marcus's gritty neighborhood in rich, vivid cinematography and restless yet graceful camerawork. Every shot is designed with precision and power to draw viewers deeper into the story, and their attention is held by the compelling performances, deft editing and a soulful, evocative score by David M. Saunders, available for listening at http://omele.to/2ylbsxZ.\n\nActor Michael Matias brings Marcus to life with a tired wariness that covers up a yearning for connection or tenderness, which comes out when Trish arrives. The way he is anxious to please and care for her in basic ways not only shows his long-time crush on her, but also an almost anxious need for any kind of attention or affection in this world of scarcity and abandonment.\n\nWilliams radiates a street-wise toughness and down-to-earth appeal as Trish. Like Marcus, she's a damaged, lonely soul in a damaged, lonely world, just trying to get by. She clearly has taken up with Darren to gain some sense of protection, and when the bully invades the rooftop haven to claim Trish back, Marcus's fragile sense of escape is destroyed and his own safety endangered in the process.\n\n\"Up On the Roof\" is both a chamber drama in its emotional intimacy and a thriller in its style and execution. It begins a beautifully constructed sense of being cloistered away from a difficult world, but as the film and Marcus reaches the point of decision, the visual bravura creates a gripping, suspenseful conclusion -- one that lingers with the viewers well after the last moments, with its powerful yet fragile evocation of hope in the face of desperate odds.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

And -- they're also caught in a time loop, which complicates their efforts to prevent the future catastrophe.\n\nWriter-director Travis Bible has crafted an energetic, smart sci-fi thriller that easily pulls an audience in with smart, clever storytelling, rapid-fire dialogue and briskly compelling pacing.\n\nThe camerawork and direction is equally confident, adding to the short's sharp, propulsive rhythm. The result is a compelling cinematic experience that is genuinely entertaining without sacrificing intelligence or craft.\n\nFans of sci-fi will be familiar with the convention of time loops and enjoy this particular riff on the subgenre. But the film also works on the level of a relationship story, with genuine emotional engagement and growth between the two brothers. Though we don't get to spend a lot of time with them, they're able to develop with full arcs as characters, making the ending surprisingly moving.\n\n\"Exit Strategy\" is being developed into a feature, and with its intricate world and clever thrills, the stories and characters should easily expand into a larger narrative. As a short, it's authentically fun, fast-paced and surprisingly resonant -- in other words, everything people head to the multiplex for.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

While he's surrounded by an atmosphere of love and happiness, he's clearly not quite feeling it himself.\n\nBut as he tries to avoid the crowd, he meets Jessie, and the conversation between two strangers eventually turns into a spark.\n\nWriter-director Joe Gillette's short romantic dramedy is a sweet, witty slice of life that focuses on how people really truly connect to one another. In a genre where the \"meet cute\" is often a little too clever, facile and clouded in fantasy, this short is well-scripted, with an eye to explore genuine emotional resonance, especially among  ordinary people who struggle with simple everyday awkwardness.\n\nWith such honest, compelling dialogue, the performances stand out, achieving a verisimilitude emphasized by the film's minimalist visual approach. Essentially a long conversation taking place between two people, the camera keeps the attention tightly on the two actors, giving the audience the privilege of watching two people come out of their shells and spark a connection between two people.\n\n\"Reception\" is simple and elegant in execution, but the ideas and feelings underlying this small-scale gem are messy, complicated, vulnerable and compelling. Open-hearted and sincere, it just may inspire viewers to look at life through the lens of opportunity -- and expand horizons in their own everyday way.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

What would you say? Are some words more important than others?\n\nStanley Franks is told by his doctor he has only 1500 words left to live. To keep himself alive, he has to use as few words as possible. But with his marriage in the balance, it's a difficult battle.\n\nThis dark comedy has an unusual premise, one that can skew surreal or slapstick, depending on the treatment. But director Andrew Chaplin uses the set-up to explore relationships, communication and connection, making for a film that's alternately charming, funny and heartbreaking all at once.\n\n\"1500 Words\" has its darkly comic moments, but with a dryly funny voiceover, excellent performances all around and deft camerawork to capture it all, it also hits real moments of empathy and vulnerability. \n\nThe result is a memorable, entertaining film whose emotional core is highly recognizable and relatable, making for a story that resonates well after its jokes and laughs land. Having only a few words left to live might be an outlandish situation to play out on screen, but it's also an interesting thought experiment to apply to one's own life.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

His doctor gives him some pills to treat his condition, though they're \"not quite FDA approved yet.\"\n\nBut after taking the pills, he begins seeing things: he sees people as horrendous monsters, creatures that control the world from the shadows and stay hidden by people's own blindness and apathy.\n\nAre they hallucinations, or is he merely seeing what's been there the entire time? His girlfriend Ellen tries to bring him back to normalcy, but she can't stop him from seeing the world as full of these monsters. He begins seeing them everyone, and convinced that they're controlling the world, drives himself to almost calamitous action.\n\nWriter-director Ruairi Robinson's thriller is a masterfully crafted piece of psychological suspense, adept at both getting us inside the head of its troubled hero and pulling audiences along with tautly constructed chills and thrills.\n\nThe plot hits familiar tropes of sci-fi and horror genres -- and many horror fans will see echoes of John Carpenter's \"They Live\" here -- but Robinson has a gift for generating atmosphere and building character without sacrificing dramatic tension. It's anchored by smart, solid performances, including one by actor Jenna Coleman (currently starring as the titular queen on acclaimed series \"Victoria\") as the girlfriend balancing concern for her troubled boyfriend with a growing concern for her own safety.\n\nA sharp eye for ironic, clever detail -- thanks to collaborator Macgregor, who co-directed Omeleto fave \"Los Angeles 1991\" -- guides each frame. Deft editing and pacing keep the story propelling forward on the fumes of paranoia, guided with charting the main character's growing instability and alternating between personal character moments and terrific action pieces.\n\nAlong with Carpenter, \"Corporate Monster\" has a look and feel that owes a debt to the great, gritty 80s urban sci-fi films, full of stories that saw urban settings teeming with danger and catastrophe. But with its paranoia that a small wealthy, powerful elite controls the world and corporate dominance has seeped into the most intimate, personal levels of human existence, its worldview is firmly of our times. Though the short is a superb piece of entertainment -- and begs for an expansion into a feature -- it gives voice and shape to the fractious, troubled undercurrents of today's social anxiety. Maybe there aren't literal monsters in today's world, the film seems to say -- but underneath the seamy underbelly of it all lies the same monstrous venality, greed and inhumanity.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As she kisses the slightly dorky guy outside a club in Toronto, she thinks she's found it.\n\nBut he lives two hours away via public transit, which makes her \"no strings attached\" encounter suddenly complicated.\n\nAs the couple get on the subway and then on a bus, what starts out as excitement gets awkward fast. But as things get real, what begins as a fleeting encounter becomes much more interesting.\n\nThis sweet, winning romantic comedy is carried by its excellent script, as well as earnest, relatable performances by its lead actors. Captured with excellent camerawork and scored with dreamy indie rock, \"Long Branch\" captures what it's like to be young, dealing with less than ideal adult lives and falling in love when you least expect it.\n\nThe journey to a delicate, budding new relationship is filled with its obstacles and rocky moments, but by the film's end, you'll want to keep following this pair into the future.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Choosing the day he proposed to his wife, he must agree to \"stick to the script\" in order for the scene to unfurl fully.\n\nBut as it happens before his eyes, he find himself wanting to make different choices and communicate something new, interacting with his wife in a whole new way. But the projectionist can't break any rules, no matter how sympathetic she can be. As Joseph presses on to take his final scene into a whole new direction, he risks cutting it short and speeding towards his ultimate demise.\n\nWriter-director Michael Lavers's short romantic fantasy marries unabashedly emotional storytelling with lush production values to evoke a beautifully nostalgic sense of old-fashioned entertainment. Filled with graceful camerawork and luminous cinematography -- the film was shot in 35mm -- it offers a lovely testament to devotion and faithfulness, as well as the way we carry love and regrets with us to the very end.\n\nLead actor Robert Hardy plays the elder Joseph with great sensitivity, easily evoking the weight of long-running emotions finally getting one last chance to come to the surface. He's supported by Oliver Tilney as a younger, more energetic Joseph, blithe and unaware with the lightness of youth, and Alice Lowe as the projectionist, who offers a warmth and empathy despite the strictness of her position.\n\nThe storytelling deftly lays down the rules of this particular fantasy with elegant economy and pacing, and then uses the looping structure of a repeated scene to explore the way grief and yearning stretch through time, connecting us to loved ones even after they're long gone.  The script and dialogue are not afraid to be unabashedly emotional, as is the soaring music and score, and as the film builds to its sweepingly romantic conclusion, it hits a grace note that is guaranteed to tug at the heartstrings.\n\n\"Joseph's Reel\" is a heartfelt and sincere film, made with great finesse and unafraid of strong sentiment or soaring romance. It may be a fantasy, but it keeps any special effects on the minimal side. Instead, it helps viewers to remember that fantasy, at its core, is all about great flights of imagination and emotion -- ones that can sweep us off our feet, transport us to a different time and place and evoke powerful emotions.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But as the eerie sounds of the dead begin to fill the air, Dao realizes too late that he should've left the tunnels.\n\nWriter-director Josh Tanner, along with co-writer Jade Van Der Lei, has crafted a supernatural horror short that practices an elegant economy on many levels, from the pared-down, claustrophobic setting to the compressed scale of the narrative. But within its 12 minutes, it wrenches an intense, vivid tension and fear from its evocation of the supernatural, all while illuminating a forgotten chapter of a military conflict that still haunts contemporary events today.\n\nMaking a film shot in a tunnel visually dynamic is no easy feat, but through judicious but moody lighting and excellently calibrated editing, the craftsmanship pulls viewers along, establishing the clashing senses of urgency that power the film's momentum: Dao believes he must pray over his fallen comrade or else his soul will haunt him, but they also must evacuate the tunnels quickly.\n\nThe writing is equally smart, precise and lean, beginning in just the right place and building the central questions that concern the narrative: are there are indeed wandering souls, and will Dao and Quan escape them?\n\nAfter an effective build-up, the film then pivots seamlessly into horror mode, crafting effectively creepy chills and thrills while ratcheting up the pace and intensity. Actor Lap Phan as Dao plays his character's agitation with just the right amount of edginess to make viewers question whether or not he's unhinged and therefore imagining everything -- a slight frisson of uncertainty that the storytelling spins into a stunning resolution.\n\n\"Wandering Soul\" takes its central idea and name from a real-life operation in the Vietnam War. To say anything more would be to give away the film's powerful reveal, but suffice it to say that it functions not just as a great twist, but an uneasy, resonant commentary on the wages of war, not just physically but psychologically. Its ending haunts like the ghosts that Dao hears in the tunnels -- and won't easily be shaken from the psyche until well after viewing.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But Fox finds itself in danger and in danger of drowning, and it's up to Dinosaur to rescue the day. But the Dinosaur hits a snag in the rescue effort and must make a difficult decision to save its loved one.\n\nThis short Australian animated film -- shortlisted for an Oscar nomination this year -- is an elemental, simple narrative. And with its dynamic, colorful visuals and vivid stop-motion, it's also visually stunning, with great attention to detail and beautifully fluid action. Each shot is precisely framed, giving the tale great clarity.\n\nThe story is essentially a classic rescue narrative, which gives directors Andrew Goldsmith and Bradley Slabe a chance to create a wide-scale and audacious action sequence that grabs attention and holds interest with expert craftsmanship.\n\nBut the creative pyrotechnics don't just work on the level of art. They're tied in with the strong, almost primal emotions in this story, which holds love, loyalty and the sacrifices we are willing to make for them at its core.\n\nAmidst all the color and action, the storytelling and editing take great pains to delineate the emotions and connections between the two stuffed figures. The relationship between them is touching and sweet, both epic and intimate at once, which raises the stakes and our investment of the story. The film ends with notes of melancholy, sadness and just a bit of hope, making for a remarkably resonant story.\n\nWith its cozy-cute characters, \"Lost and Found\" will catch the eyes of children with no problem. But its emotional and tragic depth makes it a deeply moving, heartfelt experience. Yes, the short is colorful and charming as many children's films, but with a genuine sense of loss and sorrow, its ending is guaranteed to linger well after viewing.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Alfred tries to explain how he can't identify faces -- not even his own face. He lacks a certain component in his brain that enables people to read the complex set of features of the face. He can't help the detective in finding the murderer of his ex-girlfriend Julia.\n\nPeck doesn't believe him, since he found her dead in the apartment and looked perpetrator right in the eyes.\n\nAlfred reveals how Julia tried to help him with his condition. She kept the same hair color and perfume so he'd have something to recognize her by. She was the only person who wasn't a stranger to him.\n\nA flashback reveals the murder. Alfred walks in to see Julia on the ground. He's about to call the police when he sees the killer run away. He describes the suspect to Peck's amusement. That's what Alfred looks like -- except for a dark t-shirt.\n\nPeck says there's no sign of forced entry and suspects the murder is a crime of passion. He begins to put the pressure on. And paints a scenario where Alfred wanted to be more than just friends. Then, Alfred reveals they had dated, but he was the one to break it off with Julia.\n\nHe has another girl that he loves named Laura.\n\nPeck storms out and Alfred takes out a photograph of Laura to look at. He took the picture to try to remember her face.\n\nWhen the inspector comes back, he looks different. Alfred really can't remember faces.\n\nPeck says he saw the CCTV camera from a gas station and believes that he's innocent. Then, he takes Alfred to the crime scene.\n\nOn the ride there, they talk about Laura. She's completely different from Julia. Alfred tells Peck Julia was happy for him. And she was very happy in her relationship.\n\nAlfred stands outside and begins to look at the photograph again. Then, Peck hands Alfred the autopsy photograph of Julia.\n\nPeck tells Alfred she truly did love him.

Their differences leads to a small collision of expectations and perspectives, but what it opens up in the tension offers a glimmer of hope for the would-be couple.\n\nThis lovely chamber drama, co-written and co-directed by Elham Ehsas and Azeem Bhati, is a romantic story about the search for love and the longing for connection -- something that most people anywhere can relate to. Through its beautiful writing and lovely cinematography, it captures both the hope and melancholy of romance, the awkwardness of a first date and the strange rituals and practices of modern-day dating.\n\nWhat makes this short film distinctive is its nuanced observation of how people feel the pull of their cultures, languages and traditions, even after growing up in the West.  Stylish and self-assured Harun has his foot in both his British lifestyle and his cultural background, fluent in both the cosmopolitan tastes of a London sophisticate while loving the customs and culture of Afghanistan.\n\nBut Samira is new to it all, allowing both Harun and the audience to see Western urban life through new eyes and lending her a charm, curiosity and intelligence to her characterization. Watching her learn and adapt to her circumstances, no matter how small, is a pleasure.\n\nBoth actors -- co-director Ehsas as Harun and Afsaneh Dehrouyeh as Samira -- offer subtle, genuine and honest performances that reflect the uncertainty, longing and yearning that both literally bring to the table. Watching them unravel their vulnerabilities with one another, slowly and uncertainly, is a beautiful process to behold, creating a deeply touching storytelling experience.\n\nLong-listed for a BAFTA, \"Our Kind of Love\" is a genuinely heartfelt slice-of-life short that keeps its style and aesthetic simple and elegantly pared down. There is no fancy camerawork to hide behind, or any dazzling production tricks to distract. Instead, its relative simplicity foregrounds the fact that often the biggest stories in our lives are ones where we lay bare who we are for another to witness -- and in risking vulnerability, we hope to find this openness reciprocated, leading to the type of understanding and connection that keeps us all going and makes life meaningful.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Seeking payback, he goes after the old codger.\n\nBut the other motorist proves himself surprisingly intrepid despite his clunky old car and his slow pace. As the younger man tries to outpace him and encounters one obstacle after another, the older man slogs along steadily, adding a new, boisterous twist in this update of the classic \"tortoise and hare\" tale.\n\nThis entertaining and visually striking short animation -- by directors Alister Lockhart and Patrick Sarell, in collaboration with The Lampshade Collective -- is the simplest and most pared-down of stories. Essentially the narrative revolves around a duel between two rivals, with one trying to pull one over the another. Bur rather than pistols or guns, they're dueling with cars, on a road that gives them to ultimate terrain to battle upon.\n\nThe writing is equally as stripped-down, but the pacing and editing -- as well a terrific, Western-flavored score -- keep things brisk and compelling despite the lack of dialogue. The storytelling also injects its simplicity with great humor and impeccable, striking 3D craftsmanship -- and also honors the unique landscape of Australia. Both the conflict and humor derive from two vastly different people who function at different tempos with different values sharing the same road. (There's also a few rude bits as well that punctuate the storyline.)\n\nThe animation's visual style is earthy and surreal, evoking the colors of the Nullarbor Plain as well as the stretched-out, elongated silhouettes that almost seem to melt underneath the unrelenting desert sun. The characters feel almost like rock figures that have come to life. Yet despite the stylization, the visuals are able to evoke the awe-inspiring desolation of such a long, straight, seemingly endless stretch of road.\n\nBut there's a lot of space for anything to happen, and in the end, \"Nullarbor\" exploits animation's ability to portray anything to create a final scene that's both epic in its destruction yet oddly and beautifully evocative of the Australian spirit itself. The result is a slapstick, ironic and weirdly poignant ending to an anarchic, rambunctious road movie to end all road movies: one where no one wins over the highway itself.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Ray exploits his feature as much as possible, helping him bet on races and drink more beer, much to his wife's exasperation.\n\nBut at one crucial moment, his time machine offers him a do-over at an important point in his life. But it has unforeseen consequences, putting him face-to-face with his choices -- and giving him a second chance in an unexpected way.\n\nWriter-director Dave Redman's clever comedy has a fun, quirky conceit at its center, which it explores with great wit and cleverness. Starting with its lean, focused script and nimble editing, the film bubbles along in its first half, its pacing matching Ray's blithe enjoyment of his time machine -- but also to the exclusion of everything else, like preparing for a new baby.\n\nHis wife becomes increasingly concerned and frustrated, which leads to a turning point in their relationship and a difficult truth to face. But it's also the impetus for Ray to face himself, change his ways and then, with the help of his time machine, take action to rectify his mistakes.\n\nWith the movement of the film's emotional arc, the film takes a surprising turn near its second half, as Ray comes face-to-face with his behavior and its effects on others. The style shifts into more of a high-stakes drama with surprisingly propulsive action, complete with pulse-pounding score and dynamic camerawork.\n\nWhat blends the two halves of the film are the effective performances and their consistent characterization, which are played for subtlety and realism instead of screwball antics. Ray's reaction to his discovery of a time machine is both disbelief and delight, but it's played as if on the same continuum as any other \"man cave\" escape, like playing an immersive new video game.\n\nEquating the time machine as just another giant toy for Ray to play with and underplaying its powers offers many laughs. But the central motif of the film begins to shift in meaning along with Ray's character arc, leading to a genuine shift in his development that feels logical and consistent within the film's parameters.\n\n\"Lazy Boy\" is a double entendre of a title, and the short has plenty of laughs and fun with its exploration of time travel, along with its portrait of oblivion in the face of life-altering change. But it's also a surprisingly serious examination of what it means to grow up, embrace responsibility and even become a father who must learn to put others before himself.\n\nIt's a rare comedy that, in fact, begs to be a little longer, with just a bit more time for Ray to internalize his insight and take final action. As it is, \"Lazy Boy\" points out -- in a hilariously literal fashion -- that sometimes it takes just one minute to reset our words and actions, and take responsibility for the life we're creating today.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Then, he's forced to choose between his firm belief in reality or the attraction of her fantasy.\n\nLeo and Anna are on a date. As they finish dessert, he asks about her plans for the weekend. Her coffee machine is broken and he volunteers to go over and fix it.\n\nAnna cuts to the chase. She says he can pretend to fix it and make a move on her. She adds she'll refuse, but want him to continue. He's confused.\n\nAnna makes it clear -- she wants him to force her into sleeping with him. Leo asks why he'd do that.\n\nThe waitress interrupts and asks if they'd like coffee.\n\nLeo can't believe what she's asking him to do. But Anna doesn't think there's anything wrong with playing out a fantasy.\n\nSuddenly, Leo asks if something happened to Anna as a child. She tells him as a little girl in Italy, she'd play a game, called \"Man and Woman,\" with her best friend. They'd take turns dragging each other around before, eventually, falling in love.\n\nLeo asks if Anna worries about getting hurt. Without hesitation, she pulls out a contract. Leo takes a look and begins to pick it apart. She's neglected to consider property damage and location liability. He suggests a public place would be better.\n\nThen, he sees her safe word is \"Eclair.\" He asks what happens if she's gagged, passed out or worse.\n\nThe waitress comes back and Leo brushes her off.\n\nAnna wants Leo to follow her and push her into a dark alley, then shove her against a wall and cover her mouth with his hand. Leo is silent.\n\nHe says this it's unfair. If the roles were reversed, he'd be accused of hurting women. Anna knows he's making excuses and tells him to sign it and decide later. Then, she writes her address on the contract and gives him a kiss goodbye.\n\nLeo sits and contemplates the proposal. Then, he signs the contract, before burning it.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Like other girls, they go to school, take dance classes and play together. But unlike others, they grapple with a family secret: their mother is bipolar, and the illness disrupts their lives.\n\nWhen the mother loses her job, the daughters are forced to grow up early, taking on the role of caring for the person supposed to take care of them.\n\nWriter-directors Florine and Kim Nuesch have crafted a beautiful, sensitive, finely wrought drama about the relationship between parents and children, especially when one of those parents is struggling with a mental illness.\n\nShot in warm, burnished light and crafted with images that are both resonant and gentle, the storytelling is subtle, attuned to the microcurrents created by shifting subterranean emotions, which ripple out and affect the people around them.\n\nThe film is anchored by wonderfully natural performances, and the relationship between mothers and daughters is wholly believable. The family is clearly full of genuine love and affection, but the difficulty in maintaining stability deeply affects the two sisters, who struggle with the uncertainty of never knowing what will happen with their mother.\n\nSemi-autobiographical in nature, \"Forget Me Not\" is a profoundly moving short that illustrate how mental illness affects not just the one struggling with it, but the loved ones around them. Mental illness is often ignored and many who suffer from them are often excluded from communities. But it's not just the sick who are isolated, but their most vulnerable loved ones as well.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

It's not a happy marriage -- there's a hint of past unresolved tragedy that doesn't reveal itself until the very end -- and the couple's bond hangs together on a fragile thread.\n\nIntimate, subtle and precisely constructed, this family drama captures those moments in life where a couple can go either way: they can move forward together or split apart in different directions.\n\nWell-acted all around, the short is anchored by a powerful performance by actor Mark Ashworth, who offers incredible vulnerability and melancholy as a man adrift in his own life and alienated from everyone around him.\n\n\"Grape Soda\" is full of quiet observation and patient compassion, offering a moving portrait of the powerful emotions underlying ordinary life -- and the courage it takes to confront enormous loss.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Big brother Tommy has the advantage: he's older, bigger and tougher, and he's not afraid to play dirty, whether it's stealing his little sister Tiny's food at dinner or distracting her at a school-wide relay race so that she gets off to a late start.\n\nBut Tiny has a plan to level the playing field, one that capitalizes on her smarts, ingenuity and resourcefulness -- and she goes to great lengths to score herself a small but very satisfying victory.\n\nWriter-director David Barr's cheeky, charming family comedy is a study in sibling rivalry, told with a genuine sense of sweetness that never feels too cute or cloying. Told with almost no dialogue, the storytelling nevertheless captures Tiny's world, full of the small but significant indignities that she suffers at the hands of Tommy.\n\nWith a lack of dialogue, the film is reliant on good performances to communicate character and emotion. Young performer Sophia Ally plays Tiny, bringing appealing intelligence and nuance to a role that could come across as twee. She's rightfully indignant, hurt and disappointed with how Tommy treats her, but she's also smart, and goes about her plans with a sense of pluck, confidence and patience. Tom Harrison plays her brother with just the right degree of stereotypical big-brother attitude, and his behavior comes across as casually bratty, but never hateful or full of vengeance. This isn't a dysfunctional family, but an archetypal one.\n\nWith a measured, gentle narrative pace and deliberate editing -- and backed by an excellently evocative musical score -- the audience watches Tiny research, trial and ultimately execute her ingenuous plan, building to a funny, endearing reveal. Tiny's achievement is not just brilliant in itself, but also in her precocious understanding of strategy. In this particular game of sibling rivalry, winning doesn't happen by being stronger or faster, but in being smarter in finding a different way to the finish line.\n\nMany family-oriented films can err on the side in cuteness, but what works in \"A Modest Defeat\" is how it recognizes the intensity and seriousness of the emotional life of children, even as its aesthetic decisions elevate the story to the level of a modern fairy tale. Young children in any situation often strive to feel a sense of agency and efficacy, to feel more than pawns of the bigger forces around them. They may not be scientific geniuses like Tiny, but they can rely on inner resources like cleverness, calm and equanimity to eke out the victories that build confidence and self-worth in the long run.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Their battle on the board reignites the memory of their first meeting during the Great War of 1914, where a young British soldier finds himself sharing an enclosed space with an enemy German soldier.\n\nBoth have just experienced the violence and trauma of the battlefield. The situation is unexpected and intense, but gives both of them the opportunity to look past their differences and rediscover their humanity.\n\n\"Pawns\" is a short historical drama, and though only 13 minutes long, packs an epic scope in its short duration with rich cinematic detail, artistic ambition and engaging storytelling.\n\nBut despite the impressive scope and production value, the film captures the intimacy of two people looking across the chasm created by war and politics -- and seeing each other as full human beings.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Every Wednesday, she meets with her long-suffering personal assistant Teddy to conduct matters of business.\n\nBut today, he's interrupted by a text from his girlfriend Audrey. He pauses before revealing that he broke a promise with her to work late. Shilo remembers Audrey, affectionately calling her \"goat-face.\"\n\nShilo pushes ahead and keeps insulting Teddy, even insinuating that he may be gay. Finally, Teddy reveals that Audrey broke up with him because she thinks he and Shilo are having an affair.\n\nShilo offers to help fix the situation, but Teddy refuses -- insisting that every time he shares something personal with her, she drunkenly ridicules him and forgets about it the next day.\n\nFor a moment, Shilo becomes serious. Then, she reveals all the important events of Teddy's life that he assumed she never noticed. He's surprised.\n\nTeddy then asks Shilo if she's ever loved someone.\n\nFor a brief, vulnerable moment, she opens up an old wound from her past -- about a man she could never win the affections of. As she tells the story, she sheds her armor and shows she wasn't always a cynical pragmatist -- she once felt heartache, as well.\n\nShilo and Teddy quickly exchange gifts -- small show of sacrifice. Then, they mull over the co-dependency they've come to rely on each other for.\n\nThat's when they both agree to make a change.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But their normal routine is interrupted when the class hears the sound of a gunshot nearby.\n\nThey rush to seek refuge in their gym teacher\u2019s office, trying to stay as quiet as possible, even as the shooter prowls the halls outside. But as he gets dangerously close, Michael senses something familiar about the shooter. He makes a daring move, altering both of their lives forever.\n\nWritten and directed by Oscar-nominated director Fabrice Joubert -- and produced by Samuel Francois Steininger -- this dramatic short tackles the incendiary subject of gun violence and school shootings with an unusually emotional intimacy and a careful craftsmanship that is haunting in its pared-down simplicity.\n\nThe storyline of the film -- adapted from the acclaimed short story by Lydia Fitzpatrick -- is distressingly familiar, both from other films and news headlines: a school is invaded by a shooter, putting the lives of children and their teachers in peril. But the creative approach eschews the traditional construction of suspense, where the film treats the narrative in a thriller-like way.\n\nInstead, there is an agonizing patience in how clearly and closely the camera and editing tracks the experience from the POV of the children. With a lucidity that is tense in its steadiness, the cinematography and camera movement are never agitated, and the sound design is remarkably quiet, emphasizing the importance of silence to evade detection. The performances by the cast -- which includes Rob Nagle, Garrison Griffith, Gattlin Griffith and Marie Moute -- are also collectively muted, pulling emotion within from fear rather than outwardly from panic.\n\nIn a strange way, the lack of sensationalism in the filmmaking gives the events happening onscreen both an air of unreality and quiet ordinariness. A school shooting should be a rare, unreal, aberrant event, this approach seems to say -- and yet it has become distressingly commonplace in the U.S.\n\nThe film's second half seems to shift, focusing on Michael and his interaction with the shooter and subsequently heightening the expressiveness of the filmmaking, as if letting out the pent-in tension. The visuals open up, almost offering a wider perspective on events, and the emotions surface, especially with a remarkably moving score by Mathieu Alvado, performed by the acclaimed London Symphony Orchestra. These elements combine at the end to create an unabashedly sorrowful conclusion, as well as an acknowledgment that even though our group of children in the gym may be okay, the final casualty of the film is still a tragedy in its way.\n\n\"Safety\" is many ways is a film that can't be separated from the wider context that it touches upon. While its craftsmanship at all levels is exemplary, it is also irrevocably intertwined with the real-life events it is inspired by. The fact that most viewers will know what is happening at the sound of the first shot evokes a terrible knowledge that clouds the entire narrative, giving it an urgency that its careful approach to craft belies. But by evoking the POV of those most intimately affected by a school shooting -- the children that pundits, advocates and others speak for or about, but that we often never hear from directly in the discourse around the subject -- it reminds us just what is at stake, and who is most affected.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

William, a priest in a local Irish Catholic church, is hearing confession one Sunday when Michael, an old parishioner, enters his booth, with some news: Michael has lung cancer and is facing a terminal diagnosis. Michael also has other revelations: one involving William himself, the role he played in the breakdown of Michael's marriage -- and the devastating consequences of that breakdown.\n\nNow William must try to convince Michael to keep the truth under wraps -- and grapple with his own moral dilemma as he is torn between his duty to offer God's forgiveness and his own emotions and reactions.\n\nWriter-director Paul Horan's powerful, intimate drama interrogates the role that religion, and its human intermediaries, plays in human lives, questioning just what gives them the moral authority to dispense wisdom when they themselves are fallible. It's also about the balance between social roles and personal choices, and the unexpected yet momentous impact that we can have upon one another.\n\nThe narrative is essentially a two-hander where the main characters are confined to a confessional booth, and its fulcrum involves a powerful secret strong enough to question the self-conception of its main character, not to mention up-end his life if the secret should get out.\n\nThe performances and writing dictate the aesthetic approach of the film, which uses nimble editing and well-composed shots that capture both words and reactions. Viewers will be hard-pressed to notice the visual limitations of setting -- and indeed, the close quarters emphasizes both the intimate conflict between the two, as well as their separateness from one another.\n\nThough relatively small in scale, the film is able to achieve a masterful dynamism, thanks to excellently crafted writing, which is brought to life by terrific performances that grapple with both the sensitive emotional dilemmas of the characters and the weighty subjects of morality, ethics and self-scrutiny. The storytelling lays out beautifully calibrated and paced emotional beats that subtly form the groundwork for an eventual powerful detonation.\n\nActors Phelim Drew and Francis Magee play the priest and his supplicant respectively, both offering performances that achieve subtle yet rich character arcs over the film's fifteen minutes. Michael's secrets are laid bare, and their personal impact upon Fr. William form the backbone of a story that shakes him out of what can be seen as his moral complacency. He is forced to reckon and account for his own human mistakes and limitations, especially when its consequences are so potentially devastating.\n\n\"Bless Me Father\" is well-crafted, engaging and compelling, and it's also a prime example of the power of words as the basis of human drama. The dialogue is heightened here, but still with an ear towards social realism and psychological nuance. Words -- both spoken and unspoken -- have powerful consequences in the world of the film, and both William and Michael use their words to provoke, cajole, shame and wound one another. By the film's end, it's unclear who has won, perhaps -- but we understand that much has been lost, with such a resonant, devastating impact that it renders viewers as speechless as the priest himself.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But she finds the idea beyond daunting, and feelings of crippling doubt and self-consciousness begin to bubble up in her.\n\nShe tries to get help, whether it's in the form of her family or a clueless guidance counselor. But all her attempts only make her feel freakish and alone -- as if she's the only one in the world who has these feelings. Holly then must face her fear despite her lack of support, and get through this hurdle on her own.\n\nWriter-director Danielle Kampf takes the dilemmas and struggles of its young protagonist seriously, crafting a perceptive, keenly observed drama about a rising issue among teenagers, who are struggling nowadays with higher rates of depression and anxiety than in the past. Through its solid and sensitive storytelling, it takes us on the inside of what it feels like to feel anxiety and shame so intense that it can get in the way of everyday life.\n\nThe film's biggest strength in this is its performances, particularly by its young lead Emily Rey, who gives a grounded, relatable performance while navigating turbulent emotions and reactions to the situations and people around her. Finely observed camerawork and well-paced editing give the story clarity and shape, allowing viewers to enter into Holly's struggles and dilemmas with compassion.\n\nHolly's story has a fundamental honesty about the emotional intensity and vulnerabilities of teenage life, treating its stakes and conflicts with respect. In a genre where these are often played for comedy or melodrama, the film offers genuine empathy and openness. In a world where complicated emotion is often flattened or seen as inconvenient and unreasonable, \"Presentation\" honors emotional complexity, leading the way to acceptance and empowerment.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She's caught between two friends: there's her friend Brooke, with her giggling group of cool girls. And then there is her friend Rebecca, whose status with the \"in crowd\" is tenuous and provisional at best -- or nonexistent at worst.\n\nDirector Abigail Greenwood and writer/producer Kate Prior's honest, emotionally engrossing drama looks at the social politics that rise up among young adolescents, just at the stage in life where children begin to individuate and form identities of their own.\n\nPart of this psychological work is defining one's self socially, but when the politics of being a \"cool kid\" begin to bubble up, it often reveals aspects of a burgeoning self that may surprise and even disappoint ourselves. We may give lip service to the idea of \"being yourself,\" but in the face of powerful peer pressure, authenticity is much harder to practice.\n\nGreenwood's film captures this tension beautifully, rendering the story with wonderfully adroit performances, especially between the two leads, Sasha Dingle-Bell and Astrid Lewis. One character can navigate with the in-crowd, but the other doesn't, and while their connection is genuine, it suffers as a result of the social terrain the girls exist within.\n\nTheir story is captured in beautifully subtle camerawork, which carefully charts the unspoken struggles and fissures that begin to pull at the girls' friendship. The film  floats along the girls' lives and often feels like a documentary. Combined with the tense but understated score, the film has the feel of wistful, melancholy memory, without being too nostalgic or heavy.\n\nBullying is a hot topic, but the short offers a well-crafted, beautifully observed take on the issue. With its careful build-up and intelligent writing, the story feels gentle at first, but the climax has the force of devastation. The final looks of betrayal may be rendered in silence, but their pain speaks louder than words.\n\nBy taking us into the emotional lives of young girls with respect, care and sensitivity, \"Eleven\" shows viewers how seemingly \"innocent\" practical jokes from one perspective can destroy the emergence sense of another's self and strength at such a perilous age. \"Eleven\" shows how this is both understandable and even \"logical\" when it comes to the social politics of this age -- as well as the terrible costs it enacts on both sides of the line.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The second half follows Charlie, a homeless drug addict who is trying to get through his day alive.\n\nThe two men could not seem more different on the surface, but the film's tone of gentle humor and patient compassion is a perfect lens to view the breadth and depth of humanity.\n\n\"Ironied\" is defined by its unusual two-act structure, beautiful photography and stellar performance. Both characters are portrayed by the director, but the acting is so natural, engaging and seamless than many viewers may not realize the same man portrays two different characters.\n\nSincere, genuine and made with great heart, \"Ironied\" has a beautiful message -- all of us are just trying to get through our days with some degree of grace and dignity.\n\nSong: Iron Pump by Olenka and the Autumn Lovers\nhttp://olenkalovers.com/music_oatal.html\nhttps://olenkalovers.bandcamp.com/track/iron-pump\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Luckily, he lives in a world where time travel is as easy as a trip to the local hospital.\n\nSo he travels to his past, where he tries to force his 10-year-old self to learn guitar, all in an effort to make himself more irresistible to women. But little does he know that all his efforts will backfire on him, in the most unpredictable way.\n\n'\"'m You, Dickhead\" is quick-witted, fast-moving comedy whose brisk director and breezy pace uses a familiar sci-fi element to unique effect and mines it for humor.\n\nAdd the human propensity to make mistakes -- no matter how technologically advanced things get -- and what results is a madcap and absurdist comedy that shows how we need to let go of the past before we can move ahead to the future. Or else we're just doomed to repeat our mistakes, again and again and... again.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But has Dave's viral blunder derailed his marriage, or can he dig deep and save his relationship with Sydney?\n\nDirector Foster Wilson, along with writer Brian Leahy, has created a sharply witty, caustic and engaging comedy about the strange, irresistible impulse to share intimate thoughts and private dilemmas with anyone but the person you need to talk to most. Here, the third party is the general public, enabled by social media, which allows strangers to weigh in on a very intimate, emotional question for the groom at an unprecedented scale, adding a resolutely modern twist to the age-old trope of a groom having cold feet just as he's about to tie the knot for life.\n\nThe film's strength rests on the foundation of its excellent writing, which blends smart, sharp-edged dialogue and well-observed social insights about how we conduct our lives in the era of constant sharing, likes and polls.\n\nThere are plenty of zingers and quips in the dialogue, but they're given pace and shape by nimble, quicksilver directing, particularly in the kinetic camerawork, which adds cinematic flair and underscores the almost farcical nature of Dave's situations.\n\nThe storytelling never really quite falls into farce, however, thanks to emotionally grounded performances by actors Jeanine Mason as Sydney and Josh Zuckerman as Dave. While both can deliver comedic moments with great timing and perfect arch or deadpan delivery, they also play believable people having a believable emotional crisis. Mason nails Sydney's fury, delving into how anger masks a clear sense of hurt, pain and sadness at the idea of Dave having doubts, while Zuckerman plays Dave's doubts and fears with honesty.\n\nBoth are relatable characters, which makes the final movement of \"Made Public\" that much more engaging and even heartfelt. It's a conversation that Dave and Sydney clearly needed to have before the wedding, and the fact that it's happening just before the ceremony in front of a huge audience adds both stomach-churning anxiety and awkward comedy to its unraveling. But when they get through the other side, there is genuine vulnerability, honesty and intimacy, giving both Sydney and Dave a chance to love and care for one another -- and a stronger foundation to build a loving, lasting marriage upon.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

His wife has left him, leaving him adrift and at sea in his own life -- he can't even sleep in his own bed at home.\n\nLooking to restart his life, he begins to assume the identities of strangers at a local coffee shop to avoid being alone. But his new way to avoid feeling lonely is a little more complicated than he thinks, and when he finds himself an opportunity to speak from the depths of soul, it both frees his spirit -- and lands him some trouble.\n\nDirector Hughes William Thompson's dramedy takes a common impulse we all have -- the desire to walk in another person's shoes, even for a brief amount of time -- and dramatizes, exploring the complicated emotions that it both soothes and gives rise to.\n\nCharles certainly finds himself in unique situations as he impersonates anyone but himself, but they all satisfy his desire for any human connection, however fleeting.\n\nThe strengths of the film -- which is based on the short story \"Healthy Start,\" by Etgar Keret -- are anchored in its sensitive, funny yet truthful writing and equally sensitive performances, which nail the gnawing loneliness, sadness and desire for connection that most of us will face during our challenges in life.\n\nFirmly rooted in the everyday emotions of an ordinary man, coping with the travails of life, the film shows thoughtful attention to the vulnerability and longing of its main character, but portrays it with a wry sense of humor and a gentle eye for absurdity.  \"A New Man\" is about fresh starts, however you find them -- and moments of grace and freedom in the strangest of places.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Actually, more than a funk -- a bog of serious depression he can't quite pull himself out of, even with his latest prescription of anti-depressants.\n\nHis roommate Miles, though, is convinced he can fix Charlie. He flushes Charlie's medication down the toilet and \"kidnaps\" Charlie, taking him on a fast-paced road trip to see a sunrise over the ocean. \n\nBut tensions mount as the depth of Charlie's pain is revealed -- and the ocean could be an end for Charlie, not the beginning of a new chapter.\n\nDepression is a serious topic, but this dark comedy takes a sarcastic, sharply humorous approach to Charlie's story, with its witty dialogue and finely drawn performances. But it never minimizes real pain and agony of Charlie's depression.\n\nThe result is a mordant yet funny jaunt that will make you laugh -- but also illuminates how misunderstood depression is, and how that lack of understanding makes an already painful mental health condition even more difficult.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Pavan aims to impress \"English rose\" Chloe by taking her to the most authentic Indian restaurant in the city and eventually winning her over with a confident \"heart on the sleeve, sleeve in her face\" approach to romance.\n\nBut then Chloe upend Pavan's expectations, ordering an \"authentic\" Indian dish off-menu, demonstrating a rapport with the restaurant staff by speaking Hindi and eventually revealing to Pavan her past romance with another Indian man, who she backpacked with through India.\n\nPavan -- who ordered the somewhat cliched dosas at the restaurant -- becomes insecure, questioning his own authenticity as an Indian when faced with Chloe's obvious fluency with his supposedly \"native\" culture. As the night's misadventures continue, Pavan realizes he must either accept himself as he is, or spend the evening trying to keep up in a race he may not win.\n\nDirected by Sarmad Masud, and written by Masud and Nikesh Shukla, this charming, nimble British short is both a romantic and social comedy that upturns notions about cultural authenticity while entertaining with a deft cocktail of witty writing, fluid camerawork and endearing performances.\n\nWhat works so well in the script is how it takes questions about ethnicity, authenticity and even post-colonialism and integrates them beautifully into the emotional fabric of the short.\n\nPavan assumes his \"otherness\" as a British-born South Asian man gives him an advantage with Chloe, but the storytelling delightfully unravels this assumption about Pavan, and about Chloe as well. The film plays her enthusiasm for Indian culture as both genuine, and perhaps gently questioning the idea of the \"cultural tourist.\" But despite the potential weightiness of topics like race and colonialism, there's no heavy-handedness in the wonderfully jazz-like dialogue or the effervescent comic timing of the film and actors.\n\nActor Himish Patel -- now appearing in feature film \"Yesterday\" -- anchors the film with a great turn as Pavan, who balances awkwardness, charm, and bashful flickers of both vulnerability and confidence in such a way to make Hugh Grant jealous. With each specific beat, he adroitly steers the femotional arc of \"Two Dosas\" into its final movement towards realization and acceptance. It's not that he's not Indian enough, he realizes -- it's that he and Chloe aren't a good fit. And in the end, he just needs a girl who loves dosas as much as he does.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Together they decide to hang out while waiting to talk to someone, but when Cassy discovers that Nick's ex Chelsea has been cheating on him, she convinces him to egg Chelsea's house.\n\nThe egging brings out Chelsea's current boyfriend, Brendan, who seems ready for a fight. But when another unexpected secret comes out, it upends the situation -- and helps Nick and Cassy gain some relief from their emotional crisis.\n\nDirected by Jesse D. Turk and Jon Zucker (from a script by Zucker), \"Holding\" is a quirky comedy about a serious subject. It takes a surprisingly and distressingly common real-life dilemma -- being put on hold on a suicide hotline due to high caller volume -- and spins it into an awkwardly funny and surprisingly uplifting modern-day caper about trying to get emotional relief and finding connection and meaning within pain.\n\nThe writing especially balances the tricky tone between humor and pathos. It doesn't over-dramatize Nick's pain, but it also doesn't downplay it at the service of a punchline or joke. Instead, it takes a natural and understandable human need -- here, to gain relief and achieve some kind of release from achingly acute human despair -- and plays it to its logical extreme, to oddly poignant results.\n\nVisually, the camera and editing keep the story moving, and the style is reminiscent of doc-style one-camera comedy series like \"Arrested Development\" or \"The Office.\" But this film is less concerned with modern absurdity than with the emotional lives of its characters, and it takes the necessary moments and beats to chart out the small moments of realization and decision-making that build up to its turning points.\n\nSolid performances also go a long way in moving the arc along, and actors Nick Skardarasy and Amanda Idoko play Nick and Cassy, respectively, with the energy and dynamic of a very strange buddy movie, with witty back-and-forth banter. They play off well against one another, with Cassy literally egging Nick on to take action and exert some sense of autonomy and sovereignty in the hopeless situation he's found himself.\n\nDoing so doesn't resolve the situation in the way either anticipated in \"Holding,\" but it does spur Nick out of his passive helplessness -- and find his own pain reflected and acknowledged in another. And in doing so, both he and Cassy find themselves just a little less lonely and helpless. They're both a little less isolated -- but it's just enough to get them off the edge and back into the fold of humanity.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

His job is to deliver lost and forgotten parcels to their intended recipients.\n\nHe's tasked with delivering a 10-year-old package, but it proves more difficult than he imagined. But there's no telling to what lengths this dedicated agent will travel to get the job done.\n\nClever, inventive and always engaging, this short comedy takes an offbeat premise to its full extent, resulting in a delightful romp through governmental bureaucracy, complete with oddball characters, dry humor and many zany situations.\n\nInitially striking for its unusual set-up, the film zigzags along thanks to a well-paced, engaging screenplay and terrifically droll performances, especially from actor Peter Smith, who gives a wonderfully calibrated twist to the central role. The locations possess the unmistakable patina of authenticity, but the camera captures them in a heightened way, creating the sense of a forgotten pocket of Americana.\n\nThe tone of \"Long Term Delivery\" is hugely memorable, and owes a debt to cult shows like \"Twin Peaks,\" with its blend of rural surreality. But the feel is loose, warm and lighthearted, creating a world and atmosphere that viewers will likely want more of by the film's end.\n\nTruly original in idea and beautifully executed, \"Long Term Delivery\" is a wonderful idea brought to life by a nimble story and sharply witty performances, a small slice of wonderland that takes the mundane irritation of a late package and spins it into comedic gold.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She wants a perfect \"grand\" ending to her life, something \"like in the movies.\"\n\nBut then he finds something perfectly unique to her sensibilities, which offers her everything she wanted -- including one moment of emotion she didn't quite bargain for.\n\nDirector Dael Oates offers an eccentric, wry short tale of magic realism and fantasy, mixing arch black comedy with an examination of death and mortality.\n\nThe film is anchored a wonderfully comic performance from legendary Australian theater actress Robyn Nevins, who plays the fabulous, precise \"customer,\" a grande dame who wants just the right ending to her life.\n\nEwen Leslie plays off her well, striking notes of sincerity and deviousness in a performance that essays death as both a work of art and a thing of business.\n\nThese performances are framed by glossy photography and beautiful production design, which give the film a luxurious, stylized look. Subtle special effects are used throughout, putting an uncanny touch to a glamorous but cloistered world onscreen.\n\n\"Death In Bloom\" begins with a playful metaphysical premise, but elevates what could be a simple joke into a droll encounter between death and a not-quite-everyday woman. Philosophical at heart and stylish in execution, the film offers both a confrontation that mortality is something we ultimately can't control -- and a gentle knowing laugh at the illusion that we still try, no matter what.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As a chicken thaws, Catherine mentions that Sam is being bullied in school. She tries to get him to open up, but it's obvious she's more interested in texting. The gap in their relationship is obvious.\n\nCatherine leaves Sam to iMom, but he doesn't want her. He complains that her cooking is awful. But Catherine, unaware of his pleas for affection, says she's downloaded new recipes and asks him to give her another chance.\n\nOn the way out, Catherine tells iMom to prepare dinner for 8 p.m. In the background, an infomercial continues to tout iMom.\n\nNow home alone, iMom asks Sam if he wants to read his homework to her. When he answers no, she ominously recites Matthew 7:15: \"Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly, they are raving wolves.\"\n\nSam finishes the verse and they have a brief moment of connection. She tries to get him to open up about the bullying and reminds him of a meeting with the teachers tomorrow. Instead, he gets upset and walks off.\n\nThe baby begins to cry and iMom goes to comfort her as a thunderstorm rages outside.\n\nSuddenly, a surge of electricity knocks out all the appliances, including iMom, in the house. She reboots and goes to the kitchen to prepare dinner.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam goes back to his homework, unaware of the short-circuit. As iMom turns on the stove, a larger surge knocks out the power.\n\nSam is scared and iMom gives him a hug, reassuring him that the lights will be back at any moment.\n\nWhen Sam notices another iMom on TV, he suggests she wear some lipstick. He gets some and applies it to her. Then, she gives him a small kiss.\n\nSam apologizes for his earlier comments and iMom goes to check on the baby. Then, she returns to ask Sam if he is a wolf or a sheep. He points to the sheep. Then, before iMom answers, we look into the crib and see the chicken.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As part of a secret military program hidden from the public, her work uses nuclear-powered drones to lure alien objects into orbit, and then immobilizes and captures them.\n\nBut when one such object is lured to earth and takes the bait -- and Galkina loses her connection to her commanding officer -- she is forced to make decisions quickly, and questions just what is real and what is not.\n\nDirector Hugo Keijzer, along with writer Phil M. Howe and producer Maurice Schutte, have created a superbly crafted, dynamic and suspenseful sci-fi thriller whose storytelling grabs viewers from the first moment and holds their attention with expertly calibrated suspense and drama.\n\nThough there are references to \"alien objects,\" the short doesn't lean on any VFX work or explore deep philosophical territory, like many sci-fi films. It's really a propulsive piece of cinema, combining muscular camerawork, an effective score and precise performances to put us in the moment of Galkina's crisis, navigating her dilemma right alongside her.\n\nEssentially the story is one suspenseful sequence, but it centers around one split-second decision that must be made in the most perilous of circumstances. The writing gives us just enough information to understand what Galkina is facing, but like her, we're only privy to what we've been told. When she loses her connection to her commanding officer -- and another voice enters the fray, one that contradicts her understanding and training -- she must decide quickly what to do, and essentially whether or not she can trust what she is seeing. Her decision treads the line between safety and possible catastrosphe, but it's not an easy one to make.\n\nThe ending moments of \"The Occupant\" give rise to a mystery and concern that clearly is designed to intrigue viewers and pique their ongoing interest. The title, of course, gives away that this is the opening salvo of a much larger story, and the ambition and scale of the production clearly are feature-level, beginning with the opening wide-view shots of a foggy, mysterious landscape. But as a self-contained piece, it also does its job well: it portrays one narrative dilemma with panache. But solving one problem opens up a whole other realm -- and draws viewers expertly into a whole world of danger and intrigue that they will likely want more of.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

A man talks about his first time trying tried virtual reality -- he'll never be bored again. Another junkie tells us he plays 17-hours a day, then boasts about this kill-to-death ratio. His life is simple: he wakes up, checks his rankings and then goes straight to the battlefield.\n\nThat's common. Another junkie hasn't left his house in years.\n\nOne player, who had troubles with the law, escapes to VR to express his anger in a way that isn't dangerous -- he can be himself and not go to jail for it.\n\nIn each room, the addicts hover in mid-air as they're immersed in the virtual reality game.\n\nA doctor enters. Her job is to give psychological aid in VR-dependent neighborhoods. She says the junkies aren't interested in being a part of society -- and looking at their conditions, they wouldn't have a place either.\n\nOne junkie admits he doesn't feel comfortable around people -- he doesn't know what he should say or do. Gameplay is just simpler for him -- there's no people. Just targets.\n\nWe take a look at the VR game. It's a dystopian landscape.\n\nSuddenly, a bunch of fluorescent creature jumps out and attacks the group. They pick off the monsters one by one. When the coast is clear, the group continues to move on. But one player stays behind -- he notices a rift in the game and begins to fire at it.\n\nA portal opens and he walks through.\n\nHe sees one of the creatures and walks over. Suddenly, another one jumps on his back and attacks him. He throws him to the ground and kills him. But the creature has messed up his machinery. His game begins to malfunction. The VR disappears and he's suddenly in the desert.\n\nHe sees an old woman amid the chaos and debris of a war zone. He realizes he's controlling the robot and other robots are shooting and killing innocent people. Drones hover to scan the environment, creating the events in the VR game and tying it to reality.\n\nWhen he realizes he's been a pawn, used in a real war, the player turns the gun to himself and kills the robot.\n\nBack in the real world, he crawls to the corner. Then, a robot finds him and walks over to him. We realize he's part of someone else's VR game and the robot sees him as another target to be terminated.\n\nWritten and Directed by: Federico Heller\nExecutive Producers: German Heller, Brandon Maseda\nAnimation Director: Fernando Maldonado\nVFX Production Designer: Jorge Tereso\nLead VFX Artist: Federico Carlini\nLead 3D Artist: Marco Lococo\nVFX Supervisor: Federico Heller\nDigital Art Director: Pablo Olivera\nCGFX TD: Alan RInaldi\nProducer: Federico Heller\nVFX Production Coordinator: Maria Jos\u00e9 Tabares\nAssistant Director: Nazareno Alba, Celeste Lois\nDirector of Photography: Nicolas Trovato, Fernando Lorenzale\nArt Director: Lola Sosa\nOriginal Score: Cyrille Marchesseau\nMusic Mix: Rodolphe Gervais\nAudio Post by Impossible Acousetic: Brendan J.

Whatever has landed seems to unleash his father's inner turmoil, and haunted the young boy as he grew into a man. Years later, Edward goes to unearth the truth of what just happened -- and reckons with the legacy and shadow that it cast on him and his family.\n\nThis sci-fi short -- by writer-director Josh Tanner and co-writer Jade Van Der Lei -- has all the trappings of a classic in its genre, seemingly hearkening back to the 1950s, which its evocation of Cold War paranoia, pastoral innocence and UFOs.\n\nThere's also an ambitious, adroit sense of craftsmanship in the camerawork, VFX and lighting that also fits within the genre norms, where all the technical elements of the film work together to evoke otherworldliness and awe at the film's key moments.\n\nBut unlike many genre films, there's also a meditative thoughtfulness to the writing and storytelling at the film's beginning that takes its time to observe the main characters and their relationship. Like many sons, Edward craves the love and companionship of his father, who he looks up to as the source of stability in his life. Their father-son dynamic is closely and beautifully observed, showing their bond on their own terms, whether it's through watching TV or eating dinner together or sharing silence as they stare up at the night sky.\n\nBut when something falls out of the sky and lands in a field on their farm, their quiet life together is interrupted. The small inner conflicts of Edward's father noted quietly in the storytelling -- a sense of failure, and a longing to make a difference as a man and would-be soldier -- suddenly crack open. Edward then witnesses his father in a way he has never seen before, breaking the bond between them and shattering Edward's innocence forever.\n\nIn the end, \"The Landing\" uses its genre elements -- and its unexpected reveal -- to tell a story about parental legacy, and about what happens when a child's idealization of their parent comes crashing down and they see their dad at his most tortured and ultimately vulnerable. By taking the time and space to build up the historical moment and the characters -- and taking the care to support the emotionally resonant writing with equally powerful performances all around -- it ultimately offers a moving story about love and forgiveness, where we can look at our family in their full truth, and love them anyway.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Being a virgin isn't the end of the world, of course. But when the world actually looks like it's ending very soon, thanks to an asteroid headed right for Earth, he embarks on a quest to lose his virginity before it's too late.\n\nHe heads to a party where he hopes to confess his feelings for his dream girl Jessica. But when he arrives, things go awry -- very, very awry, and he finds himself launched into a panorama of odd, desperate human behavior in the face of the end of all endings. But all hope isn't lost for Samuel, as he soon realizes what, and who, really matters in the end.\n\nDirector/co-writer Charlie Schwan, along with co-writer Wyatt Miller, have created a hybrid of comedy, drama and sci-fi that takes the emotional dilemmas of a classic teen film and adds an unusual genre twist, making for a funnier, more resonant story at its end. Set in the late 70s, the feel and look of the short are reminiscent of the warm, burnished amiability of films like \"American Graffiti,\" but the playfulness with genre and awkward physical comedy are both fun and modern.\n\nThe writing and storytelling mines great humor in the teen hijinks and debauchery that Samuel descends into on his quest to swipe his V-card. The dialogue is funny, but not with the relentlessly clever pitter-patter that characterizes a certain strain of teen films.\n\nInstead, it finds a good-natured comedy in Samuel's physical awkwardness around his peers, and in his own emotional awkwardness within himself. The film also gets its pacing and rhythm from Sam, as well, building his character and relationships, which pay off with unexpected richness at the end. Things don't go the way Samuel envisions, but he still gets his heart's desire in the end, even if his own happy ending is brief and incandescent as the light of the asteroid on the horizon.\n\n\"The Goodnight Show\" is a genuinely warm film that balances an affably goofy look at the foibles of humanity with an understated tow of melancholia. As Samuel goes about his quest, the story threads in the range of responses that people have when faced with an imminent demise.\n\nSome seek out the warm refuge of their loved ones; others look for isolation and detachment, even in the titular strip club that Samuel finds himself at during the course of his evening adventures. Some may say Samuel's own ending may be somewhat predictable, but the ending's predictability isn't a fault. When rendered with genuine heartfelt sincerity and a poignant combination of emotion and craftsmanship, it's actually comforting in its faith that, when faced with deciding what truly matters most, people will follow their hearts.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Along the way, he meets a robot running from the war after years of battle.\n\nWei eventually names the robot Red, and together they join forces to escape. But eventually they encounter the enemy, sparking strange behavior in Red and causing Wei to doubt his growing bond with the robot.\n\nWriter-director Mike Pappa has crafted a remarkably emotionally engaging sci-fi short that melds both a sense of old-fashioned entertainment with an engaging narrative about PTSD, war and its effects on soldiers.\n\nOn the surface, many filmgoers will immediately reference iconic sci-fi classics like 'Star Wars' and 'E.T.' The film has a sense of impressive sense of cinematic sweep, thanks to its deft and judicious use and execution of special and practical effects and rich, detailed cinematography. The relationship that builds between Wei and Red seems initially innocently combative, even playful, filled with wisecracks and sarcastic barbs. It's an interesting riff on the buddy action-adventure, evoking the pleasure of watching two very different characters from very different backgrounds work together to reach a common goal.\n\nBut as the narrative develops, the short endows Red with a rich sense of interiority. His dialogue and body language is highly specific and revealing, and the robot often takes great pains to keep and care for Wei.\n\nThe voice work that actor Daniel Clarkson brings to the role makes full use of rhythm, diction and cadence to convey Red's innate intelligence and even \"humanity.\" He plays off young actor Maddox Henry well, who captures Wei's youth, sarcasm, innocence and determination. When Red reveals his true background -- and the sadness and tragedy he has no understanding of -- it forces Wei and Red to confront their differences and learn to trust one another.\n\n\"A Crimson Man\" is on the longer side for a short, but audiences will likely feel we've left Wei and Red's story -- and the world of their story -- all too soon. The film starts off with the feel of a sci-fi action adventure, but it deepens into something ultimately more resonant and haunting, looking at how the effects of combat and a lifetime of war affect those who fight in it -- and how it affects their relationships after they attempt to leave fighting.\n\nThe \"twist\" is that it's the robot who has what audiences will recognize as PTSD -- and who seems to have more humanity within him than most people who occupy this dystopian world. Like Wei and Red themselves, audiences will come to care for this unlikely pair, and will wonder just what fate befell the duo well after the story ends.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They thought it was a rogue comet, but it deliberately banked around Jupiter to slow down and crashed into Earth. Raymond Davis, a researcher with the Department of Homeland Security, was one of the first scientists to arrive at the scene of impact.\n\nFrom the crater, a giant, skyscraper-sized alien emerged. They called it the \"Visitor.\"\n\nEmily Field, a clinical psychologist at the University of Southern California, explains the reaction. People fear what they don't understand and responded with aggression. So humans fired everything they had at it, which had absolutely no effect.\n\nThe Visitor didn't even respond. Instead, it heads into Los Angeles and waits.\n\nMeanwhile, Colonel Gus Wilson, a Department of Defense consultant, worries the alien is extremely dangerous and a threat to humanity.\n\nField disagrees since the Visitor is incredibly passive -- it might be lonely. There's also a fundamental innocence about it. In the evenings, it likes to go down to the reservoir, and in the mornings it crosses the city to watch the planes fly out of LAX. In between, it spends a lot of time at the beach, just sitting -- almost like it's biding its time and waiting for something to happen.\n\nBut Wilson doesn't buy it. The peace and quiet, he says, might be ongoing convert enemy actions.\n\nDavis, meanwhile, records sounds coming from the alien. They sound like distress signals to him. But Field thinks Davis sees patterns where there isn't any. Wilson, on the other hand, believes the signals might be calls to bring friends for reinforcement.\n\nDavis, Field and Wilson debate the conflicting theories as the Visitor waits. The Narrow World examines how humanity projects its fears and beliefs on something utterly inexplicable -- and what it reveals about our true inner selves.\n\nOver the years, the residents of Los Angeles just accept it as part of the scenery.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Who took what from the office refrigerator, dealing with the boss... all in a day's work.\n\nBut then the universe begins to merge with an alternate universe, and soon duplicate versions of every human on Earth pop up everywhere, often making life annoyingly complicated.\n\nBut soon the world adapts. And for Booker, it gives him a chance for love, when he meets the doppleganger of the dream girl he's had a crush on.\n\nThis sci-fi short is a droll take on the concept of alternate universes. The idea of human doubles is handled like a hilariously mundane complication -- instead of one boss, people now have two of them, and keeping them straight is no easy matter around the office.\n\nEven with its sci-fi premise, \"Doubles\" is a drily funny portrait on how people can mire themselves in the minutiae of life, even when the extraordinary happens -- and we face the gulf between who we are and who we wish to be.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Using an advanced version of augmented reality, they take on new roles in the hopes of enlivening their long-term partnership.\n\nBut the game takes an unexpected turn as they begin to question one another's perception of reality, their history and even one another. The role playing begins to shine a light on the gaps in their communication and intimacy and forces them to confront the blind spots of the past.\n\nFilmmaking team Ft. Langley -- William Wilkinson and Oliver P. D. Brooks -- have crafted a small chamber drama in the guise of a sci-fi short. Technology plays a key role in the drama, but the subtle but effective special effects are in service of a searching emotional dilemma for the couple at the center of \"Double Vision.\"\n\nThe AR might allow the couple to see one another the way they wish to be seen -- and avoiding their present-day physical realities -- but it also means they can dodge the uncomfortable buried resentments that have caused their marriage to congeal and stagnate in the first place. Anchored by solid storytelling and performances and enhanced with crisp, clean cinematography, the story is an emotionally astute, lucid exploration of how technology impacts our inner lives, shaping our identities and relationships.\n\n\"Double Vision\" keeps its science on a raw, intimate scale, resulting in a film that's a discerning portrait of the intersection between cutting-edge technology and human yearning. We think we're getting closer to what we want with each new advance -- but getting what we desire may actually force us into terrain that challenges us in ways we may not be ready for.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The well-written script never shies away from their sexuality, capturing through a situation that most people can relate to in some way. The need to feel seen, heard and understood by someone close to you is a universal desire -- and a journey that many people, no matter where they stand in the continuum of human sexuality,  have some trouble traversing.\n\nThe camerawork is intimate and agile, capturing the excellent performances by Hannah Pearl Utt and Jen Tullock, who portray both the points of tension that have built up between two people but also the investment and love they have for one another. Watching them wrangle, banter and try to understand one another offers both a sense that human relationships can be tricky for anyone -- but the reward is both well worth it and necessary.\n\nA hit at Sundance, \"Partners\" may run only seven minutes, but it possesses an emotional intelligence that has an impact well beyond its conclusion. Hugely entertaining and wonderfully warm-hearted, it offers a funny, lovely window into one rich moment in a couple's life together, in a way that many can understand and relate to.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They hang on one another's words, they spend time together in the forests and beaches near their Virginia homes and their attraction for one another is clear. But they are also of different races, living in 1940s Virginia, making their romance forbidden and even dangerous.\n\nTheir relationship is discovered, and their love for one another is tested when bigotry rears its head, putting their relationship -- and especially Monica -- in danger.\n\nLush, atmospheric and visually sumptuous, filmmaker Joyce Sherri uses every element in the cinematic toolbox to craft a jewelbox of a romance, exploring an interracial relationship set in 1940s Virginia.\n\nThe storytelling can be languid, taking time to build the chemistry and sexual tension between the film's central couple. The sensual, tender camerawork capture the give and take between the the lead actors, Tashiana Washington and Jordan M. Cox, placing them within the tableax of a beautiful natural landscape full of water, sunlight and trees.\n\nBut their Eden-like romance can't escape from the real world tensions and politics, and when their relationship is discovered, it means danger to them as a couple.\n\n\"Forever\" contains elements of fantasy, but these are very much rooted in the emotional life of the characters, reflecting their unspoken hopes, dreams and fears. Fantasy is often an underused genre when it comes to exploring race and history in cinema, but Sherri uses it here to powerful effect, as an acknowledgment of both the bond between Monica and Beau but also as a commentary on the harsh reality they find themselves living in.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Now one potential couple are on their first date, and all seems to be going well... until they begin talking about astrology.\n\nThis short is a modern riff on one of the most fundamental stories of the human condition: two people meet, circle one another as they try to figure out if they're a fit and then clash over differences.\n\nBut it's what happens during the date and afterwards that makes this a unique and intriguing film. What starts off with the trappings of a romantic comedy quickly becomes more resonant, thanks to finely honed, compelling dialogue and acutely poignant performances that deepen the initial personae that both main characters present to one another. Both actors render the tension, conflict and attraction between them with great skill and sensitivity, feeling like full-fledged people in the span of under 15 minutes.\n\n\"This Always Happens\" then goes to a deeper place of self-reflection, questioning why we self-sabotage our own aspirations for happiness and feel the need to judge others so quickly and harshly. The result is a film that goes beyond its topic of dating and romance, and feels vulnerable, achingly open and courageously personal.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But Banks-Davies offers a take that's just a little bit different, taking on deeper psychological nuances and exploring issues of cultural identity.\n\nBy tackling the \"morning after,\" she explores the unique situation in which two people who connected the night before must find a connection in the bright light of morning, where their very real differences reveal themselves more fully.\n\nWhat's unique about Myra Appannah's screenplay is not just the crackling dialogue, but the way the characters conceal and dance around their truths, longings and expectations. They grapple with their attraction and desire for one another, but also the weight of cultural expectations and embarrassment -- not to mention the vulnerability that comes from making a connection and wondering exactly what it means, especially as they begin to get to know one another at a deeper level.\n\nThe performances are often the key to a romantic comedy's success, and \"Garfield\" offers two strong central lead actors, Mandeep Dhillion and Matthew Travannion, who handle both the lighter comedic elements as well as hit the deeper notes of uncertainty, honesty and vulnerability required by the story.\n\nThey play well together, and watching them laugh and jostle one another with genuine enjoyment make it a pleasure for viewers to see these characters come to a new understanding together -- even when Garfield spends most of the film in a costume onesie.\n\nAnd they're captured in lively handheld camerawork that beautifully situates both characters not only in relation to one another, but also within contemporary London. There is a naturalistic, documentary feel to the film, and while the story hits narrative beats adroitly, it's done so subtly that it feels like we're watching life unfold naturally, carried along by characters that navigate their uncertainty and still somehow a new way to engage one another.\n\n\"Garfield\" has plenty of charm and wit, with a story and characters that are both specific yet relatable, in a way that makes us feel like a fly on the wall of an evolving love story. By the time we've been charmed and drawn in by Krishna and Garfield, the film ends just a bit too soon, leaving viewers wanting more -- and hoping that the pair rode off into the gray London morning to a happy future.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But eventually Jacob must untangle his past memories and present fantasies in order to finally speak his truth -- and move forward into his future with a new sense of honesty.\n\nWriter-director Travis Mauck's blend of fantasy and drama is about the interplay of past and present, and how memories push and pull at our emotions. Essentially a type of fantasia into Jacob's subjectivity, the film is visually stylish, with gleaming colors, beautiful cinematography and polished camerawork that lend a heightened yet realistic feeling to being inside Jacob's head.\n\nHis imaginings are on the strange, surreal side, but they blend seamlessly into his memories of his relationship with Amber. While the visions are chaotic and emotionally fraught, the scenes in the past exist in a different emotional register, with quiet and subtle performances alive to what's unspoken between the couple. They're honest, touching and sad -- and very relatable to anyone who longs for the past, as imperfect and wrong as it was.\n\nThe accelerating intensity of Jacob's visions pushes him to speak honestly to Amber, and confront his own true feelings and desires, leading to a final sequence that's both visually ravishing and gently heartbreaking. Fantasy and reality become entangled and harder to tell apart from one another, but when the illusion is finally punctured, the moment is subtle and quietly devastating, both for Jacob and the audience.\n\n\"Only In Dreams\" is ultimately a sincere and emotional exploration of how to reckon with our past, with its unfulfilled longings, sadness and regret. Unabashed in its romanticism and filled with relatable moments, it takes awhile to settle into its own unique rhythms. But once it finds its footing, it creates a deeply personal journey that leaves viewers with a lyricism that makes the melancholy of life meaningful -- and just a little more endurable in its beauty.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He loves Alison deeply, but it's become clear to him that he's giving more than he takes -- and the imbalance is making him question just why he's so committed in the first place.\n\nDirector David Lester, along with writer and co-star Jessica Rose, has crafted a short film that initially begins like an entry into the \"crazy girlfriend\" annals of film. The first half is structured like a continuous nocturnal misadventure, as Jay steadily cares for an increasingly outlandish Alison, and we feel his exasperation and frustration as she careens from one extreme to another. The quiet, contained direction and muted cinematography adds to the sense of being cordoned off in the middle of the night, both alone and lonely even in the presence of someone you love.\n\nThe film is no holds barred in portraying Alison's wild antics, and Rose gives a remarkably brave, distinctly raw and unvarnished performance as Alison, touching on both the almost desperate charm on the surface and the gaping, grasping need underneath it. Actor Kristopher Turner plays off her beautifully as the steadfast Jay who is growing burdened by his role in the relationship and the lack of balance in it, and though his arc is subtle, it carries the emotional momentum forward.\n\nThe film's quieter second half explored the cost of this imbalance in even the most steady and consistent of partners. Almost like a M\u00f6bius strip, it reveals a different side to both Alison and the relationship. The writing confines its narrative scope to the present tense, and doesn't offer a lot of background information on Jay and Alison as a couple. But this beautifully directed, delicately calibrated \"morning after\" scene enriches understanding and adds complexity, showing that a relationship has its challenges -- but perhaps also unexpected riches, compassion and tenderness in places and moments where it's least expected.\n\n\"Alison\" illustrates the idea that a relationship is often like a foreign country where only two people have passports to enter and experience its mysterious terrain. It starts off wild and unpredictable as its namesake, but it settles into an unexpectedly rich portrait of those \"in between\" moments in a relationship that unexpectedly form a pivot point, a next chapter in the journey. We don't know what will happen next for Jay or Alison, but the indeterminacy of the ending feels true to the idea that commitments aren't chosen once and then done -- but must be chosen again and again and again, as life, people and understanding evolve.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

This experience makes the film's remarkable portrayal both authentic and compassionate.\n\nBut you don't need to have a stutter to relate to a story about summoning up the courage to approach a crush -- and coming up with a way around and through fear. Charming and warm-hearted, you'll find it hard not to root for Thaddeus -- and be impressed by the lengths he'll go to get the girl.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But one day, tired of being told she's too young to go up, she sneaks out and discovers something even more terrifying than she could ever imagine.\n\nWriter-director Steve Desmond -- along with co-writer Michael Sherman -- has conceived a fresh, inventive horror short that uses every element in the cinematic toolbox to create a compelling, effective storytelling experience about growing up, taking risks and being curious about the larger world beyond your childhood.\n\nWith its tautly paced storytelling and editing, its ability to parse out just enough details to create a whole world, its terrific set of performances -- including \"Say Anything\" actress Ione Skye as the mother -- and its excellent score and sound design, this short feels much bigger in scale than its short runtime.\n\nThe dynamimc camerawork is able to evoke a world outside the bunker that is much larger than its dark confines, and each propulsive story beat is created with immense skill and craftsmanship, powered by young Jenn's desire to go outside. As she makes it outside, the camera movement and other elements also increase in scale, ratcheting up the tension and questions that drive Jenn along.\n\nJenn's character is deftly drawn, and her drive to go outside is understandable. She may be young, but her character is active and resourceful, brought to life in a capable, excellent performance by young actor Caitlin Carmichael, who delineates every emotional beat of Jenn with precision and specificity. But the time she makes it outside, she discovers something much different than the story about monsters she has grown up with.\n\nLike many horror films, there's a terrific twist at the film's conclusion that recasts the narrative we thought we knew, inviting compulsive rewatching. And like other films in its genre, \"Monsters\" is also a powerful parable about the sometimes difficult moment of shedding childhood beliefs when confronted with the truths of the larger world beyond childhood.\n\nThis being a thrilling horror movie, these realizations comes with a dose of harsh reality, emotional agony and the shattering of childhood innocence -- not to mention a sickening realization that the bigger world of adulthood we longed for so much is actually an illusion and a trap.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Cole tells them it's harmless. As they try to catch it, Xavier jumps out and kills it with a machete. He tells them they need to find some real snakes.\n\nDylan is upset and starts to bury it. Suddenly, a red-and-black snake appears and bites him.\n\nThe boys are frantic. Dylan and Tyler describe the snake to Cole and he looks it up. If the tail is black, Dylan is fine. But if it's red, it's the Black Widowmaker and the venom will kill him in less than 10 minutes.\n\nXavier tries to slow down the venom with a tourniquet. Then, Tyler tries to suck the venom from the leg.\n\nDylan tries to stay calm. There's no time to go back to camp and tell the adults. Xavier has an idea and grabs the machete.\n\nTyler and Cole tell him to stop, but Xavier insists there's no better option. Dylan starts screaming -- he refuses to chop off his leg.\n\nXavier reasons if they do nothing, Dylan will die. Cole lists a bunch of reasons Dylan could survive, but Xavier insists it's unlikely.\n\nThey leave the decision to Dylan -- they can either take him back to camp and there's a good choice he'll die, or they can chop off his leg.\n\nDylan tells them to chop it off. They tells them it's a good choice.\n\nXavier grabs the machete and Tyler tells him a little higher -- just to be safe. As he raises his arms, Cole tells him to swing with his eyes open so he doesn't miss.\n\nAt the last moment, Xavier says he can't do it. Tyler tells him to man up and chop off the leg. He just can't, so Tyler switches places with him.\n\nTyler aims and raises his arms as Xavier holds Dylan down. Then, Dylan sees the snake with a black tail -- it's not poisonous. But before he can tell them, Tyler begins to swing down.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But as the conversation unfolds -- and the hitchhiker acts strangely -- the pair begin to wonder if the man they've picked up has dangerous intentions.\n\nWriter/director Max Silver, along with producer Rachel Sklar, have crafted a suspenseful, clever thriller that continually pulls viewers in with its potent mix of glossy yet gritty visuals, deft storytelling and high-adrenaline action.\n\nThe film is contained narratively to what's essentially one long scene, but within that stretch is a well-plotted and well-written roller-coaster of a story that understands how to set up viewer expectations, elongate them for maximum tension -- and then expertly skew them to generate even more surprise.\n\nTop-notch visuals also go far to continually engage and intrigue the eye, and the camerawork mixes sweeping desert views with more intimate shots and editing within the car, tracking the interplay of conversation and subtext. The two female leads banter and spar as they bring the dialogue to life, with Jessica Jade Andres as the hyperconfident extrovert next to Kate Krieger's more closed-off, skeptical Priss.\n\nThey're engaging as two modern, independent young women out on an adventure, although that adventure is not what it seems, especially as we slowly uncover the mystery of their hitchhiker -- played with snake-like charisma by Jordan Turchin -- through their eyes. The story meticulously constructs its central mystery of the hitchhiker with well-placed breadcrumbs of clues, and what they discover eventually leads to a pulse-racing, gripping and gristly climax.\n\n\"Trunk Space\" is a stylish, suspenseful piece of entertainment, offering feature-worthy production values while keeping the storytelling smart and focused for its short narrative scale. It seems to read as just another action-thriller on the surface, but with a well-placed (and very fun) twist, it teases that its glossiness actually belies other secrets and meanings worthy of re-watching, as well as a darker underbelly than initially thought. It's that primal fear and curiosity of looking under the lid of the box -- and discovering what's underneath is murkier and more disturbing than you could ever imagine.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She stands alone as others mingle in the ballroom. The host introduces her partner Olivia, a new member from a European bridge group. Olivia is everything Mattie is not -- outgoing and refined. When Olivia goes to kiss Mattie on the cheek, Mattie is clearly uncomfortable.\n\nAs they play bridge, Mattie makes a carless play. Others say that's the worst bidding they've ever seen -- to which Olivia defends Mattie.\n\nMattie apologizes to Olivia, but says she'll do better. Olivia tells her she had fun even though they lost. Then, she leans over to kiss her goodbye and whispers, \"I'm going to kill you.\"\n\nLater that night, Mattie is nervous as she enters her home. Her husband Don tells Mattie they take bridge too seriously. He humors her. But Mattie insists she didn't mishear Olivia and isn't safe.\n\nThe next day, she walks to walks to the dry cleaners and sees the back of Olivia and quickly turns around. In the supermarket parking lot, she thinks she hears the sound of Olivia's high heels and rushes off. She goes to the hairdresser and dozes off, dreaming of walking into the bridge group. Everyone is saying how beautiful Mattie is. Then, Olivia's threat drowns out the others.\n\nShe wakes up to see Olivia standing in front of her. Olivia says she's looking forward to practice. Mattie makes a half-hearted excuse that she has things to do. Olivia insists. She says to play elegantly, they must look the part. Olivia then grabs Mattie's hands and cuts it.\n\nMattie approaches Eileen about switching partners. But Eileen won't have it.\n\nMattie brings some treats to the bridge group. Olivia is the only one there. Mattie asks her about the threat, assuming she misheard it. Olivia tells her a story -- where she's from, there is sheep and dogs. And sometimes, the dogs will hide among the sheep and kill for sport.\n\nMattie begins to get worried. She asks when the others aren't coming. Olivia begins to play with the knife on the table. Olivia continues to talk about the dogs. They think the dogs kill because of the passive nature of the sheep -- it triggers something primal in the brain of the dogs.\n\nOlivia asks Mattie if she understands. When Mattie says she's doesn't, Olivia makes it clear -- Mattie is her sheep. And she is the dog.\n\nThen, she unleashes a bark.\n\nOlivia adds that dogs can't wait to kill, but she can -- she likes to wait.\n\nThen, Mattie looks at the knife next to her.\n\n\"The Bridge Partner\" is adapted from a story by Hugo Award winning author Peter S.

The procedures, performed live in front of victims' families, are carried out over several years and stop only at relatives' request.\n\nWillie is informed he's been selected after murdering an innocent little girl while intoxicated. He'd prefer to be executed, but he doesn't have a choice.\n\nOn the day of the first procedure, the victim's family walks in to see the operation. They decide how far the surgeries will go. The father picks up the telephone and confirms he'd like the operation to continue. Then, the doctor takes the scalpel and cuts off Willie's left hand.\n\nRecovered, Willie is taken around to schools, where he shows the children what his criminal ways got him.\n\nIn March, they removed Willie's right arm with a saw. Then, they send him to the more difficult high schools.\n\nWillie's supervisor tells him that everyone is happy with how things are progressing and that the victim's father should be satisfied soon.\n\nGradually, they remove his limbs, and a kidney and lung. Willie is a shell of his old self. He sits in a delusional state, watching footage of his operations.\n\nFinally, he goes in for the last surgery. He has no observable emotion. They remove his ears, nose and the tip of his tongue. As Willie lays in bed, motionless, covered in bandages, the victim's father walks in and signs the paperwork, disgusted at what he has enabled.\n\nThat was five years ago. The light in Willie's room is always on. He lays, eyes to the ceiling, dead silent -- except the last week of every month. That's when Willie goes to the high schools.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Exhausted by the constant care of the baby and trapped in an increasingly claustrophobic house, she begins to question her husband Vincent's love and intentions as a more sinister side to him emerges.\n\nDirector Joe Kicak's atmospheric psychological thriller is a acutely sensitive portrait of a couple in crisis after the birth of their new baby. Marked by superb craftsmanship, a sensitive but tight script and excellent acting, it looks through the eyes of the young mother, offering a uniquely intimate, tumultuous and psychological perspective of a particularly different life transition.\n\nThe film's images and camerawork are superlative, with its moody lighting and eerie movements. But with its psychological themes and subjective point-of-view, it really rests on excellent performances, especially by lead actress Heli Kennedy, who captures the irritation, exhaustion and agitation of a new mother adjusting to her role while still grappling with the expectations of her marriage. Riddled with anxiety, she becomes increasingly angry with her husband and what she perceives as his lack of contribution and understanding.\n\nAs the tension ratchets up between the couple, the film's images, soundtrack and camerawork become even more ominous, shadowy and restless, and the house itself seems more and more haunted and foreboding. The tone subtly shifts, molding itself to the main character's growing mistrust and paranoia and reflecting the strange moments of disassociation and even blackouts that the Lean experiences at her most challenged, isolated and stressed. The editing becomes more discontinuous, creating a sense of uncertainty over what exactly is and isn't real.\n\nThe result is an increasingly tense narrative that becomes so taut that it threatens to snap with the suspense. The emotions evoked are visceral and heightened, and true to the psychological thriller genre, the film gets hearts racing and pulses pounding as it races to its almost unbearable climax.\n\nBut the short is also a deft, powerful portrait of postpartum depression and psychosis, alert and sympathetic to the textures and sounds of a new mother's reality: the insistent wail of a child just as a mother sits down to rest, the attunement to the baby's needs at the expense of the mother and the way that exhaustion and severe sleep deprivation can cause disassociation and alienation from the rest of the world. The last moments of \"Frigid\" may leave audiences gasping in shock and fear up to the very end, but its evocation of postpartum mental illness will linger, well after the last frame.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She also has a tendency to lie about what she's done. Her mother decides to take matters into her own hands, changing the cookie jar from a cute ceramic bear to a terrifying clown face.\n\nBree will have to confront her fears in order to satisfy her sweet tooth, but when the parenting lesson goes awry, Bree has to confront something a lot bigger than just her mother.\n\nDirector Justin Harding's comedy-horror short is a funhouse of clever thrills and chills, starting with the clever new take on the old-fashioned fear of clowns. There have been many scary clowns in film history, but this short manages to offer a fresh new entry in this tradition, thanks to excellent special effects and art direction.\n\nThe script is briskly paced and engaging, brought to life by stellar camerawork, photography and great performances, particularly by the young lead, Ava Jamieson. She captures the emotions and character of young Bree with an ease that marks her as a screen natural, and we never  lose sight of the story's stakes as we experience the film through her eyes.\n\nWell-made and engaging on every level, the film is an entertaining watch and genuine creepy fun for fans of the horror genre. Capturing the way childhood terrors can become larger than life, particularly in the mind of an imaginative child, \"Kookie\" updates a primal fear in a modern way -- and is guaranteed to send shivers down the spine.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

It's part of her plan to commit every \"horror movie sin\" in the book -- drinking, drugs and having sex -- to lure a murderous psycho to her house and take him down.\n\nThis thriller features nervy, skillful camerawork -- and a creepy killer wearing a Star Trek \"Spock\" mask. Hamassian ratchets up the tension with a \"shot in one take\" feel that spotlights the actors' deft performances.\n\nBeyond the well-crafted chills and thrills, the movie operates with keen intelligence. Like its meta-horror brethren -- think the \"Scream\" franchise and \"The Cabin In the Woods\" -- it plays to traditional horror fan expectations while offering a clever, ominous twist on the genre.\n\n\"Night of the Slasher\" is a smart, subversive horror movie perfect for Halloween -- with an ending that will leave viewers wanting more.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

A hard worker, he finds himself stuck in an endless cycle of tasks and deadlines, and the idea of going home for the day begins to recede into the distance.\n\nBut he has a time-sensitive secret that makes overtime a tough proposition for Ralph. And when it comes out, all hell breaks loose for Ralph, redefining what it means to have a bad day at the office.\n\nStylishly shot and narratively tight, this comic horror short, directed by Craig D. Foster, has plenty of visual aplomb, wit and bite to keep viewers engaged. The pace of the film is nimble, quick and sure-footed, complete with flashes of humor and romance that add dimension.\n\nLike many great horror films, the craftsmanship of the film is excellent: the camera is always where it needs to be to create the most dramatic impact, the performances are perfectly calibrated and the editing keeps everything humming along, creating a compelling and even gripping experience.\n\nBut ultimately, this short film is highly relatable, taking a situation that many workers are familiar with and injecting it with great fun, enjoyment and maybe even a little wish fulfillment. With aplomb and panache, \"Overtime\" is an energetic, impeccably crafted romp through how work never seems to end, how we sometimes want to throttle our co-workers -- and how our needs bump up against the dictates of the office, to superbly comic effect.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

In his wooziness, he sees a black-clad figure of a man appear on his security camera... but he isn't in the same place in the store.\n\nHe wonders if he's seeing things in the middle of this long night, but as he begins to investigate, things aren't what they seem -- much to his potential peril.\n\nDirecting team Matt Black and Ryan Polly -- who form part of the Texas-based filmmaking collective Maker Table -- have crafted a masterful, suspenseful psychological horror film about the gulf between perception and reality.\n\nIts runtime is a compact 8 minutes, but it packs a feature's worth of intensity within that time. What it accomplishes within the short timeframe and the compressed narrative scope is a start-to-finish cinematic rollercoaster of tension and terror. It easily takes its place alongside classic psychological horror films like \"Repulsion,\" where a possibly compromised protagonist conjures an inner vision that might dangerously bleed into reality.\n\nInstead of swerving into surreal territory, the short explores our contemporary landscape of screens, and the ways they purport to reflect objective reality, yet very often do not.  The narrative then takes this growing fracture between the virtual worls of the screen and the physical realm of reality, and exploits it for a chillingly scary experience.\n\nLike many horror films, the short leans on impeccable craftsmanship and dynamic camerawork, which expertly directs viewers' attention to the moments and details that reflect the clerk's compromised state of mind and raises the question of whether what he is seeing is truly \"real\" or just a figment of his sleep-starved imagination.\n\nExpert editing tightly controls the pacing and unraveling of the tension growing as the clerk begins to wonder if he is in danger of attack. The film knows how to tease at a definitive meaning and answer, but also when to pull back and let uncertainty fill the gap, to often deliciously frightening effect.\n\n\"Monitor\" is short but highly effective, and its evocation of terror doesn't lean on gore or disgust but the flickering, fragile nature of certainty, especially in a world where reflections of reality are often doctored, interpolated or altered. Smart, taut, tense and chilling, it should appeal to fans of intelligent, cerebral horror -- or anyone who's ever questioned if what they see on the screen is real.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Most of these creatures are sunken into a catatonic sleep, unaware of anything outside their hermetic, sealed-off world.\n\nBut one of them emerges from the crowd, stunned into consciousness. Young and growing, the creature starts to cause a joyful ruckus, but struggles against the disapproval and rancor of the rest of his box-dwellers. But then the youngster begins to fight back, looking for a way outside the box but coming against its most oppressive forces yet.\n\nWriter/director/animator Dusan Kastelic's short animation is a surreal yet exuberant allegory about the pleasures and perils of non-conformity, being an individual and pushing through obstacles to a new level of consciousness.\n\nThe narrative takes the phrase \"outside the box\" and spins it into a deeply imaginative, hypnotic narrative that resembles a fairy tale. Not a sanitized children's version of a fairy tale, however: the film instead resembles the original European fairy stories, which were dark, psychologically complex and disquieting in their emotional violence.\n\nThe images are nightmarish, with their evocations of distorted flesh and murky colors. But the expressiveness of the creatures and attention to detail -- created in open-source 3-D software Blender -- are remarkable from a technical and emotional level, and draw in viewers with a powerful combination of gesture, sound and storytelling.\n\nDespite the claustrophobic world portrayed in the film, there are splashes of zany humor and joy, particularly as the younger creature expresses its unbridled childlike self. The musical score and sound design by Mateja Staric go a long way to create contrast between stultifying conformity and youthful individualism, as well as keeping the narrative at a consistently engaging pace.\n\nDespite its strange appearance, the uninhibited joyousness and high spirits of the newly emergent creature are so much like the energy of children, and viewers cannot help but relate. Yet \"The Box\" becomes genuinely sad and painful as the youngster is repeatedly brought down and cut down to size, and confronts the mechanisms of the box itself that keep its inhabitants docile and in the dark.\n\nWatching that struggle becomes a powerful metaphor for the oppression and conformity that we all face, whether it's the box that society puts us inside or the ones we put ourselves in. To watch the creature struggle against a dark, narrow world is hard, and yet, as the creature discovers, as long as you can feel a spark of an essential self, there is always a way towards the light.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The shepherd has a remarkable ability: he shears the sheep and creates clouds with the wool, which rain upon the valley, keeping it verdant and fruitful with plants and nature.\n\nBut when the shepherd passes away, the valley begins to become barren, and the sheep are in desperate need of shearing. The dog must find a way to continue the shepherd's work -- or risk the decimation of his home.\n\nCreated by students from the French animation school MoPA -- Valerian Desterne, Juan Olarte Zuniga, Carlos Osmar Salazar Tornero, Lucile Palomino, Juan Pablo de la Rosa Zalamea, Celine Collin and Rebecca Black -- this wise, gentle animated short uses its serene, whimsical visuals, storytelling clarity and an impeccable score to weave a beautiful parable about nature, balance, loyalty and legacy.\n\nIt charms the eyes and ears with its soft, rounded shapes and beautifully clear colors, rendering both characters and settings with sensitivity, grace and keen attention to detail and gesture to communicate emotion.\n\nWhether it's in how the shepherd pets the dog or how the canine wags its tails, the love between the pair is well-worn and palpable, as is the dog's grief and bewilderment when the shepherd passes on. Yet there's also soft, good-spirited humor to be found, as when the sheep puff up with their exuberantly overgrown wool.\n\nAnd like the best of animation, which uses its ability to imagine anything to create magic beyond realism, there's also a lovely sense of surprise and delight in its flights of fancy, as when viewers watch wool become life-giving clouds, with a whimsical lightness and buoyancy.\n\nBut it also doesn't shy away from the problems and dilemmas found even in this little corner of paradise, and when it becomes clear that the dog must find a way to continue his master's work.\n\n\"After the Rain\" really excels with its storytelling, and though its running time is less than nine minutes, it possesses the profundity, wit and wisdom of much larger narratives. Like many great stories of children's literature, it taps into the archetypal and symbolic, using universal emotions and dilemmas in service of moral and emotional clarity.\n\nUsing charm, humor and a sense of pastoral innocence, \"After the Rain\" gently teaches a lesson about the interconnection of nature, as well as the way we honor a loved one's legacy and meaningful commitments. It places living beings with agency and the ability to act as a crucial part of the larger ecosystem, and in a way, implies that we are all shepherds looking after nature, picking up and continuing the work and responsibilities of the good spirits before us.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Whether she sits at a coffee shop, hangs out at a park or walks down a street, her imagination and sketches add in some magic lost by those around her.\n\nMadrid-based director and animator Carlos Lascano has created a fairytale-like short -- using a beautiful blend of live-action and animation elements. The whimsical tone underlies a deeper message of hope and optimism in the face of a cold and confusing world. Her eyes beaming with surprise, love and wonder.\n\n\"Lila\" is the last film in Lascano's aesthetic trilogy, starting in 2008 with \"A Short Love Story In Stop Motion,\" then followed in 2011 by \"A Shadow of Blue.\" Produced on shoestring budgets, he proves that great storytelling don't have to cost a fortune -- just a lot of hard work and a bit of creativity.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

These \"hearts\" reflect their owners, but they can also be easily lost in the fray of life.\n\nWhen Mary suffers a romantic disappointment, her heart begins to languish, and both become despondent and lose their zest for life. In the lowest of her doldrums, Mary loses her heart, making life flat and dull.\n\nBut Mary begins to find her way back by reconnecting to life, and is soon reunited with the most valuable part of herself -- which too has been on its own journey, and in search of its own happy ending.\n\nDirector Rob O'Neill's charming, timeless animated short -- written by Michelle Cuevas and produced by Josh Ludmir -- takes advantage of the genre's ability to develop flights of fancy into deeply affecting and lovely storytelling, beguiling with unique detail while offering a lesson in emotional intelligence.\n\nThere is no dialogue in the short, but the solid writing nevertheless stands out, with a full character arc for Mary and a wealth of quirky detail that makes the world both recognizably ordinary and yet adorably fanciful. The idea of hearts living outside of the body as a kind of companion both offers a strong metaphor for emotions as well as a springboard for beautifully developed whimsy.\n\nEveryone's \"heart\" is unique to them, with personalities both reflective and yet different from their owners, and the film has a lot of fun showing the diversity of people and hearts in this world. The cornerstone of the story, though, focuses on the central heroine and her heartbreak, pulling in viewers with each finely tuned epiphany and revelation.\n\nThe big draw, of course, is the striking animation, full of bright dynamic color and long, lively elongated lines and movement that tantalize and engage the eye. The details are charming and expressive, rewarding multiple viewings. When combined with well-paced storytelling and a terrific musical score -- courtesy of composer Thomas Faragher and featuring a track by singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams -- it's simply a pleasure to watch, both entertaining and resonant.\n\nThe ending of \"Follow Your Heart\" is almost inevitably happy, but it's a hard-won happiness borne of struggle, experience and time. Though it's full of vibrant color, funny moments and exists on a generally upbeat, cheerful register, there's still considerable emotional wisdom at its core -- and a charming reminder that our hearts perhaps know best what will offer true happiness, if we learn how to listen to what they have to communicate.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Trefor is dead and becoming a ghost, but he's still hung up on paying the gas bill. Cari is a lonely Goth girl who is waiting for the apocalypse to happen.\n\nBut as these three lives intersect, they have unexpected connections and influences, changing each of their existences.\n\nWritten and directed by Lauren Orme and produced by Amy Morris, this BAFTA-shortlisted animation is about fear and anxiety, capturing the vagaries and travails that plague us, and how the rising anxieties can isolate us from one another.\n\nThe visual style is artful and modernist, and in many ways evokes the art of Amedeo Modigliani, especially in the almost surreal elongation of faces and bodies. There is a smoothly textured, paper-like feel to the animation as well as a subtly dark moodiness to the palette, which captures the flatness of affect and emotion in the trio of characters. Each of the three feels profoundly alone as they grapple with their issues, which range from anxiety to low self-confidence to loneliness.\n\nThe writing has a sharp eye for the absurdities of modern life, and how these seemingly bumps of red tape and bureaucracy take on added weight when we're already alienated. The narrative pacing is deliberate, preferring to build up character, world and situation, though it raises questions of whether or not the end of the world is nigh -- and just how these characters will encounter one another.\n\nThey play marginal roles in each others' lives at first, as voices on the other line or passed by on the street. Their coming together coincides as each confronts deeper truths about themselves -- and come through to an unexpected \"other\" side.\n\nA production of Ffilm Cymru Wales and BFI Network Wales, \"Creepy Pasta Salad\" has plenty of dry wit, a wry cheekiness and a striking visual sense, all of which come together to capture something of the alienating absurdity of modernity. But like many fairy tales, it penetrates under the surface of life into the magic and enchantment possible when we fully face our fears -- and realize that in the core of our deepest fears is often the seed of our liberation, if we only trust and accept our abilities to confront and be transformed by them.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Vowing revenge, the animals band together to exact brutal revenge on the humans who have dared trespass on their natural habitat.\n\nThis Oscar-longlisted short -- directed by Maryka Laudet and Quentin Camus, and co-directed by Paul Antric, Lea Georges, Zoe Sottiaux and Corentin Yvergniaux -- begins with a charming, colorful and idyllic sequence of two hikers in love, enjoying nature and one another. It's sweet and romantic -- until a pole falls down a cliff they're climbing, impaling a poor little groundhog below in a gruesome death.\n\nThe juxtaposition of bright whimsy with the macabre is the first clue that this short is no mere children's cartoon. It may be called \"Wild Love,\" but the storytelling is truly a wild ride, segueing from romantic comedy into a dark horror tale of violence, mayhem and revenge. The visual imagination is dextrous and detail-oriented: the character and world design are both cute but increasingly creepy, whether it's in the moodiness of encroaching evening haze or the growing martial-like bloodthirstiness of the forest's rodents, which have banded together to exact revenge on the hikers.\n\nThe pacing and editing also know how to build sequences of tension, with brisk pacing that keeps the audience entertained and wondering what happens next. As the action propels forward, it achieves the tautness and tension of a climax straight out of a horror film -- complete with a corpse puppet, a showdown and a grisly end.\n\nCreated via the same initiative that paired French animation school Ecole de Nouvelles Images with French animation collective MegaComputeur -- which also resulted in last year's Oscar-nominated Hors Piste -- \"Wild Love\" is a thrill-filled romp that relies on a good amount of cinematic shock-and-awe -- though much of the shock is in how far it's willing to push at the cultural trope of the \"cute animal,\" one that powers the sharing of millions of videos, memes and social media accounts devoted to adorable critters.\n\nBut perhaps there's a wary lesson for us humans, who have never quite been able to subdue the collective desire to dominate nature, whether it's through brute force or the condescension of cuteness, however well-intended or seemingly benign. In a state of peace and rest, nature is beautiful, but it's not just a backdrop for a selfie. When disturbed or damaged by human presence, the earth can marshal considerable resources -- okay, maybe usually not in the form of an army of vengeful critters -- in a reaction that's pitiless against the people causing the problem to begin with.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Omeleto is proud to share its diverse slate of shorts for this year -- as part of its inaugural Fuse Directing Program -- which is inspired by the vibrant communities of Los Angeles and united by a comedic sensibility that can range from bawdy to caustic to offbeat, but is always emotionally grounded.\n\nHannah is a devout Orthodox Jew, who observes the tenets and practices of her religion, including abstaining from electronics of almost any kind on the Sabbath.\n\nShe's also a modern woman who lives in Los Angeles, the most modernist of American cities. So when a certain device of hers won't turn off, she sets out to find someone who can turn it off without violating her religion -- a \"shabbos goy\" outside the faith who can perform certain types of work for Jews who can't partake on the Sabbath.\n\nWriter/director Talia Osteen's nimble, quicksilver comedy combines the bawdiness of a certain type of ribald comedy with a richly observed snapshot of how a tradition-rich religion and culture thrives in a modern setting, where diverse groups of people are nestled alongside one another but often don't deeply interact.\n\nLike many comedies, the success of the film rests on its writing and performances, and both here have a sharp, sly eye for irony and the peccadilloes that arise when we're trying to hide things we're embarrassed, ashamed of or not supposed to do.\n\nHannah may be an Orthodox Jew, but she's also embraced aspects of modern womanhood, though that embrace can't exist out in the open. Yet she must find a way to reconcile these sides of herself -- a dilemma that propels her to reach out into the larger world.\n\nThat world is shot with a warm polish in the cinematography and a subtle grace in the camera movement, capturing a vision and side of Los Angeles that's warmer, humbler and livelier than most cinematic representations of the city. The visuals beautifully capture how the city is a series of hidden pockets, and Hannah goes outside of her particular enclave to solve her problem.\n\nThis leads her to Davian, a young Black man, who she enlists to help. The two likely never would have met if not for Hannah's immediate problem, but the dilemma forces them into an interaction that is both sweetly cringe-y and hilarious to watch. Actors Milana Vayntrub and Devere Rogers find a great comedic rhythm together that is true to both the wit and humor of the dialogue and the emotions of the characters. When all the elements come together in an impeccably paced crescendo of mishaps -- and Hannah's predilection comes out in the open -- it's an absolute delight of comic timing and culture clash.\n\nSmart, witty and playful, \"The Shabbos Goy\" has a lightness of touch, but that sense of free spirit doesn't elide over the characters' social realities, which are deftly acknowledged in ways that don't interrupt the pleasure of the storytelling. Instead, it invents ripe comedic opportunity in playfully setting up a collision between contrasting lives and people -- and finding warmth and affection in the ways people can be there for one another, on the most basic level.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Omeleto is proud to share its diverse slate of shorts for this year -- as part of its inaugural Fuse Directing Program -- which is inspired by the vibrant communities of Los Angeles and united by a comedic sensibility that can range from bawdy to caustic to offbeat, but is always emotionally grounded.\r\n\nRachel lives in Los Angeles, and is a recent transplant from the East Coast, starting anew as she deals with a difficult breakup. Despite her new California lifestyle of juicing and jogging, she clearly hasn't gotten over her ex and unable to embrace the laidback nature of her new home.\n\nAfter a fraught conversation, she decides to go on a date with a guy \"outside her type.\" But the date -- a Black man who's an entrepreneur -- goes off the rails, revealing just how out of place Rachel really is.\n\nWriter-director Jeanne Jo, along with co-writer Keenan Coogler, has crafted a clever, gloriously awkward comedy short that combines wit and social observation, examining how tricky social issues can seep into everyday personal interaction -- and just how crazy first dates can be.\n\nIt's an acidic take on the typical romantic comedy, built on a foundation of intelligent writing with an eye and ear for self-delusion. Essentially a set-up leading into a classic two-hander, the revelation of story and character happens primarily through dialogue, which here is sharp and smart, but most importantly true to character.\n\nTaking place in Los Angeles, the film establishes anxious, edgy Rachel in the sunlit environs and lush greenery of Los Angeles. She's a fish out of water, and she's about to realize just how out of her element she really is, especially when she meets her date, a relaxed, affably confident Black man.\n\nBoth main actors -- Scout Durwood as Rachel and Walter Fauntleroy as her date -- have a nice back-and-forth that reveals potential chemistry between the pair. The masterful dialogue handles the subject of race in a way that feels both funny and true, as Rachel goes out of her way to avoid it, and avoid seeming racist.\n\nYet Rachel keeps stepping into tricky waters with various gaffes, many of which threaten to derail the date. But in the ironies of all ironies, a telling anecdote reveals just how neurotic Rachel is -- and proves crazy is crazy, no matter what your identity.\n\n\"Rachel From New York\" feels very much like a snapshot of one woman's dating life, overlaid with a filter that punches up the brights with heightened dialogue but throws her flaws and contradiction into a high-contrast spotlight. Entertaining, light and spiky all at once, it ends with just a sliver of hope for Rachel -- and a knowing laugh for the audience, who will have no illusions about Rachel's future misadventures.\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Omeleto is proud to share its diverse slate of shorts for this year -- as part of its inaugural Fuse Directing Program -- which is inspired by the vibrant communities of Los Angeles and united by a comedic sensibility that can range from bawdy to caustic to offbeat, but is always emotionally grounded.\r\n\nFarrah is new to Los Angeles and looking to get her footing, both socially and professionally, in her new city. She's on her own and a bit of a \"fish out of water,\" navigating a complicated place where surfaces are not always what they seem.\n\nBut then she uses an app called \"Get Glam\" to find new customers for her hairstyling business. Her first appointment is for a house full of girls looking to be styled for a party. When she arrives, the party has already started... but that gives Farrah the opportunity to prove herself, and the fresh new start in life she's been looking for.\n\nWriter-director Thembi Banks's engaging, winning short is a part slice-of-life, part observational comedy about taking risks and managing tough transitions in life, and coming out on the other side with a new feeling of confidence and empowerment. It's also about all the strange and unique ways we can find community and friendship, even in the oddest of circumstances (and apps.)\n\nMuch of the film's strength begins with its foundation of smart, strongly observed writing, often finding humor in the way vivid personalities and characters intersect against one another. Played with an almost elegant understatement by lead actor Raven Goodwin, Farrah is apprehensive and a little retiring as she approaches her appointment, and at first the new environment brings out her shyness. But she begins to bloom when she embraces the moment and focuses on her talents and skills.\n\nShot with a combination of warmth and down-to-earth texture that captures its unique setting in L.A., the story captures a part of Los Angeles not often put on film. Baldwin Hills is a historically Black neighborhood in the city, with its own rich history and sense of place, and it forms the perfect backdrop for one Black woman's reinvention. The storytelling also pulls in the role that hair plays for Black women and the way that communities can form around beauty and self-care, both of one's self and one another. Hair is a key talent for Farrah, and it is also the way she begins to find her way in this ad-hoc party -- and what may be her first community, and victory, in the city.\n\nA selection at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, \"Baldwin Beauty\" celebrates Black communities in Los Angeles, but it's also about what it means to strike out on your own and find yourself -- and in taking those risks, wrack up the small victories that add up to a beautiful, satisfying and hard-won life.\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Adrift and insecure, she's trying to figure out what went wrong and where she needs to go next.\n\nBut, on a simple shopping trip at a grocery store with her mother, all of Sunny's confusion and anger comes to a head, as she faces what it means to be an adult and her own fears of falling short.\n\nWritten and directed by Jess dela Merced, this short dramedy is both a portrait of a young woman dealing with a severe case of imposter syndrome and a firecracker of a comedy, with acidic, witty yet honest writing about finding one's place in the world while balancing the weight of familial expectations.\n\nThe narrative structure is essentially a slice-of-life snapshot, constructed from whip-smart dialogue and performances and a natural yet dynamic approach to visuals. Sunny is captured in the stultifying environs of a suburban grocery store, often in roving moving shorts that emphasize the setting as much as her character. Through its sometimes cheeky eye for composition, its bright glossy colors and a terrific sense of movement, the images situate Sunny as a proverbial fish out of water, and her caustic, sarcastic response to finding herself back at a place she thought she had moved beyond.\n\nOne of the great pleasures of the film is just how much the storytelling is able to milk humor and character detail out of this one setting, which brings together a wide cast of quirky types, a natural place for families to go together and visuals full of color and energy that speak to the bustling, variegated cultural landscape of America. There's a great eye for the telling, ironic detail, and great comedy bits -- including a confrontation with a snotty kid influencer and her equally trendy mother -- are threaded throughout, which explore this predominantly Asian-American and Hispanic slice of greater Los Angeles. Yet all these moments ultimately funnel down to building Sunny's character, from how she sees the world to how she sees herself.\n\nIt reveals a young woman who feels like a failure and an imposter, for both not succeeding in her work but perhaps also failing the imperatives she feels as a daughter of immigrants. This angle is handled with a great lightness of touch,  hitting notes of sharp, spiky humor. But it also makes for some of the richer moments in the film, as Sunny has to face where she is in life, even as she tries to hide her own doubts from her family.\n\nSmart, fun and observant of the tensions navigated by next-generation children of immigrants, \"Phony\" is a contemporary snapshot of millenial \"adulting.\" But it's also smart about how that process is complicated with expectations from parents from other countries searching for broader paths to success for their children. Part of being an adult may not be the avoidance of failure, but what you learn from it -- and the resilience you build in the process.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As a CODA -- a Child of Deaf Adults -- she has grown up with two parents who cannot hear. But she can hear and exists in that world as well.\n\nBeing pulled between the two sides of her life has been hard all her life, and the division within her has affected all parts of her life, including her performance in her school's dance program, where she hopes to emerge as a choreography.\n\nThen she meets Josh, a charming, handsome and kind drummer who is deaf. Alex falls for Josh and pretends to be deaf to fit into his world more easily. But when Josh finds out the truth, Alex is forced to grapple with and unify the two disparate parts of her life and her self.\n\nWriter-director Erika Davis-Marsh's compelling, poignant drama captures a perspective and community that rarely gets much screentime. Combining aspects of family drama, dance and romance, it combines beautifully observant writing with rich, intimate camerawork and strong performances to deliver a portrait of a woman trying to find her place in the world.\n\nThe storyline toggles between scenes from Alex's childhood and her present, making connections between being a CODA and her current journey to find a place she belongs, whether it's romantically with someone else or in her creative practice. But Alex finds it difficult to integrate her experiences: she's different in the hearing world because she has deaf parents, but she doesn't quite fit in the deaf world either because her ability to hear sets her apart.\n\nActor Kerrynton Jones beautifully portrays the internal dilemma that Alex grapples with, able to capture both the euphoria of finding a kindred soul and her voice while also the fears and confusions of never quite being understood. The film is notable as well for using three deaf actors -- Ryan Lane, CJ Jones and Antoinette Abbamonte -- who give wonderfully vivid, emotionally engaging performances that offer a glimpse into how it feels to move and live as a deaf person, pursuing passions and raising families like their hearing counterparts.\n\nThe story of \"CODA,\" however, belongs to Alex, and ultimately her story is one of a coming-of-age, where she finds her place in the world and takes ownership of her own experience and voice. Seeing her incorporate American Sign Language into the movements of her choreography to tell her own story forms the core of the film's heartwarming final sequence, and it's powerfully and unabashedly triumphant. Viewers won't soon forget the sense of uplift and will likely want more of Alex's story, as well as a deeper foray into a world that often sits parallel yet invisible to the hearing one -- but is rich and full of unique beauty.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But before the boy can wonder who the stranger is, he's told to do his chores by his father, Mr. Jones, a stern and harsh man. This is the same man who will murder his wife and mother at the breakfast table, right in front of the boy and his sister Lucy.\n\nThe two terrified children remain on the isolated farm with their father, who slowly twists the children's questions around to sculpt a new memory of what happened in the children's mind.\n\nHe also begins to be a little kinder to Freddy and Lucy, though a tinge of threat rears its head when Freddy especially questions the details that the father begins to plant in his children's minds, especially that of a stranger with red hair, big white teeth and white hands who came into the home and hit their mother in the head.\n\nBut despite everything, justice catches up to the father -- though not without having an indelible, chilling effect on the minds of his two young children.\n\nWriter-director John Conway's quietly riveting psychological drama -- based on the haunting short story by American literary great Stephen Crane -- takes place in post-Civil War America. But with its emphasis on the malleability of memory, emotion and feeling -- and the twisting of innocence to nefarious ends -- it feels startlingly modern and contemporary.\n\nThe literary pedigree of the source material informs the film's artistry, and the storytelling takes its time to set up character and setting with great care and detail. There is a sober classicism in the craftsmanship, with rich and shadowy cinematography, stately editing, and a darkly bewitching musical score. The result is an atmosphere of mystery that pulls viewers in the dark, twisted and unnervingly calm world of the Jones family.\n\nThe performances are especially effective in their understatement and matter-of-factness, especially of Mr. Jones, who begins the film as a shadowy, opaque figure shrouded in shadows -- a harsh voice coming out of a dark silhouette. Actor Brett Rickaby ably shades Jones with a foxlike calculation, especially as the father ramps up a false warmth and conviviality with his children as his own lies escalate with them. He pulls his children in as co-conspirators in his deception -- and though it is not enough to keep the secret in the end, its effect on Freddy and Lucy is incalculable.\n\n\"An Illusion In Red and White\" is a fascinating watch, especially at a time when there is much discussion about gaslighting, a form of psychological manipulation in which a person or group covertly sows seeds of doubt into someone, making them question their own memory, perception or judgment. But the real twist of the knife is watching a father twist children's natural desire to win the love and approval of their parents to cruel and selfish ends. The final scene encapsulates perfectly just how lingering such manipulation is, and how persistent a child's desire to love and believe in their parent can be -- much to tragic effect sometimes.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But Dale finds it's not as easy as he thought to get back into his daughter's good graces, as he begins to reckon with the choices he's made in the past.\n\nWriter-director Maria De Sanctis, along with writer Geoff McFarlane, have crafted an astutely observed family drama alive to the tremendous pull that love and loyalty hold in a family -- and how deep-seated hurts and resentments continue to reverberate when they're not adequately addressed.\n\nMany family dramas rest on a foundation of excellent writing, and \"Father by Law\" is no different, carefully charting Dale's efforts to be part of his family. Its script is especially skilled at juggling the shifting tensions and conflicts shimmering underneath the surface of a wide group of characters as Dale attempts to insert himself into the wedding festivities and get the dance he feels entitled to.\n\nThe storytelling -- powered by the sharp eye of the directing and the deftness of the editing -- captures each character's perspective with terrific specificity, but it also manages to convey the power of a collective familial portrait, and viewers get the sense of an entire psychological and emotional ecosystem. One member's actions have consequences that ripple out, affecting everyone else -- and especially so during a high-stakes event like a wedding.\n\nThe character of Dale is the motor of the narrative, and he's played by actor William Russ -- who fans of the sitcom \"Boy Meets World\" will recognize as Alan Matthews -- with both well-meaning love for his daughter and an inability to see beyond his own wants. As his daughter, actor Annie Clark is able to embody a pain going back to childhood that is genuine and heartbreaking when it finally comes out. It's only when he's confronted with his daughter at his lowest point when Dale begins to understand the real meaning of being a parent: a deep desire for their children to be happy... even if it means setting their own desires aside. As he sifts through this personal revelation, he begins to understand and reconnect with the meaning of parenthood and is able to put those realizations into action.\n\nEnding on a series of notes both sweet and quietly wrenching, \"Father by Law\" is heartwarming, but it comes by its warmer feelings by being honest about the pain. Minimizing the pain of others or making excuses to cover up feelings of sadness, shame and inadequacy are stop-gap behaviors that may make us feel better in the moment, but come at the expense of affection and trust -- especially when it concerns the children we're expected to love and guide to adulthood.\n\nYet, as \"Father by Law\" shows, it is never too late to make amends, and get our most important relationships on the right track -- especially when we have genuine compassion for those we affect and true courage to look at ourselves.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

To prove himself and boost his sense of safety he seeks out shooting lessons from a reclusive ex-militia member and survivalist.\n\nDirector Arman Cole's dramatic short grounds an incendiary nexus of topics -- gun culture, mental health and more -- in a compelling coming-of-age story about a young man looking to gain a sense of power in a world that renders him helpless and fearful.\n\nThe film's subject matter could easily fall into overbearing and didactic territory, but instead the story is rendered with a subtle, understated sense of direction, grounded in complex, powerful performances. The characters -- played by Tyler Young and Dominic DeVore -- are likable, sympathetic and above all human, with desires and needs that are easily understandable. When the film takes an unexpected turn, it's both surprising but understandable, given the richly intimate acting and insightful writing.\n\nThe film delves into timely territory, offering a searing look at a subject that draws intense feelings on both sides of the issue. But by pointing a lens upon today's issues with well-calibrated emotion and powerful storytelling, \"Small Arms\" accomplishes what powerful art does: it puts a mirror up to our society and challenges us to look closer at the world we make with our words and actions.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Li Shan is a doctor in a hospital in Guangzhou who notices that this isn't any typical respiratory illness they've seen before. Yet, to his distress, the government lies about the illness, saying it is just regular pneumonia. Li Shan believes that this nascent epidemic is something more: SARS.\n\nLi Shan confronts his supervisor about hiding the nature of the illness but is subsequently suspended from his job. Putting his health on the line, he sneaks back into the hospital to steal a blood sample to test the virus and confirm his suspicions. Increasingly desperate as misfortune falls upon his own family, he attempts to find a way to treat it, and finally reveals the truth to the public.\n\nWriter-director Wenqi You's suspenseful drama may be about SARS, and its complications of government suppression of information at the expense of human lives is highly topical. But it's about more than just an epidemic. Featuring an engrossing, well-calibrated script and a thoughtful approach to craft, it's also a portrait of heroism, and what it means to persevere in the face of indifference, secrecy and lies.\n\nThe strength of the narrative lies in its steady focus on its titular character, unraveling the complexities of the epidemic as he confronts treacherous political obstacles, work policies, family commitments and the demands of his own conscience. The scope of the storytelling is quite wide, especially for a short, and yet with the clarity of the filmmaking and detail of the writing, we never lose sight of Li Shan and how he wrestles with the problems he encounters. The result is a resolutely humanistic perspective on a subject that can quickly become abstract, especially as numbers add up and the human experiences they represent become more distant.\n\nActor Zhan Wang brings Li Shan to life with great subtlety and precision, and through his performance, viewers understand the increasingly difficult decisions he has to manage, as well as the growing stakes. Li Shan is a complex character, and he's not played like a saint, but a flawed, deeply human person who is trying to do his best under increasingly desperate circumstances and make hard choices -- choices that can complicate as much as save lives.\n\nIn the end, it's this nuanced interrogation of what heroism really means that creates resonance and provokes thought in \"Li Shan.\" Public health is a complicated mosaic of influences, policies and realities that can seem overwhelming to conceptualize, but we can all understand Li Shan's struggle to do the right thing in the most challenging and imperfect of circumstances.\n\nHeroes are defined not by just the results they achieve, but the way they forge ahead and take action to do what they believe is right with great courage and fortitude. These decisions are never perfect because human beings are not perfect, but they almost always require bravery and a willingness to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

At his funeral, her Uncle Al tries to console her in the way he knows best, by letting her drink the beer she asks for and trying to console her by telling her to look on the bright side: at least both her parents didn't die.\n\nBut underneath his feckless demeanor, there's something more, especially as he begins telling Esme a remarkable story: a tale about a magical tree that can bring his drawings and sketches to life. The tree and its keeper, Grey,  brought a young Al comfort in various ways during his troubled childhood, where he too reckoned with the death of a parent and the resulting loneliness of his grief.\n\nCurious and skeptical, Esme picks up where Al's journey left off, and she discovers just how true Al's story really is -- and just what magic is left in the world, despite all of its pain and sorrow.\n\nMagical, sharply funny and moving, this short fantasy explores the power of creativity and imagination to console, soothe and delight, often by evoking the very magic of cinematic craftsmanship itself to dazzle the eye and warm the heart.\n\nVisually, the short is a marvel, mixing beautifully saturated cinematography with gorgeously intricate animation. The look and feel of the film have an elegant richness to them, one that both acknowledges the melancholic emotions that underlie the characters in the story but also the vibrant, poetic role that unfettered imagination plays for them.\n\nThe writing and performances all also have tremendous wit to them, both subverting the expectations that are typical to stories about children and yet respecting the complexity of their emotional experience. While Uncle Al is a risque character in giving Esme a beer and encouraging her swearing, he also treats her feelings seriously and recognizes the depth of her pain, something that's especially valuable in a world that would prefer to look the other way.\n\nActor Glenn Howerton -- best known for his role on much-beloved comedy \"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia\" -- plays Uncle Al with the insouciance and rebelliousness of a bachelor uncle. But underneath the demeanor is also a moving thoughtfulness as he reckons with his own lingering memories of grief. By sharing his story with Esme, however, he lifts a considerable burden from his own spirit -- and rediscovers the spark within himself.\n\n\"When Pigs Fly\" has flights of fancy, a sense of transgressive naughtiness and charm to spare, but it's also grounded in the idea that childhood isn't just an idyllic freedom unshackled by grown-up responsibilities and dilemmas. Instead, there's an acknowledgment that the interior lives of children are full of their own thorniness and difficulties. Through navigating this rough terrain with the help of empathy, imagination and play -- and the help of adults who see and hear us for who we are -- we can come through to a deeper, richer understanding of life and people, and a remembrance that there is still magic to be found, both in the world and within ourselves.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

After not being paid for overtime and facing financial difficulties, he decides to steal a suitcase at his work in retaliation for being blown off by his boss.\n\nBut then two planes crash into the World Trade Center, and the suitcase takes on new significance. Upon opening the pilfered bag, Joe discovers something he did not expect: plans for a terrorist attack. The discovery turns his life upside-down in ways he never anticipated, pushing him to think and act in ways he never has before.\n\nWriter-director Abi Damaris Corbin's powerful drama/thriller is cerebral yet propulsive storytelling at its best, with the look and feel and the ambitious narrative scope of a feature. It takes its time to carefully lay out the moving pieces of what becomes a complex gameboard. But as the story unfolds, the pieces fall into place with a weighty sense of inevitability-- and shows how the smallest, seemingly inconsequential details are actually the most crucial.\n\nAs with many thrillers, much of the film's initial power rests on an excellent command of craftsmanship. The muted palette, quicksilver editing and a meticulously constructed script efficiently establish character, details and stakes, with a sense of resonance and responsibility. The narrative is actually quite complex and must structure an interlocking chain of events with care and precision, and yet the storytelling moves quickly.\n\nBut when the film takes its time to settle upon the central figure of Joe -- a humble everyman with issues, problems and concerns -- he proves to be a grounding figure in this complex narrative. Through actor Mojean Aria's strong performance, Joe gives audiences an anchor as a swirl of circumstances quickens with intensity, as Joe and his fellow baggage handlers watch on TV as two planes crash into the World Trade Center towers.\n\nIt's undeniably that much of the poignancy of \"The Suitcase\" rests on its historical import, on an event that still exerts a powerful influence on geopolitical events and policy today. But it offers a different window to look at the sweeping events of 9/11, one that showcases how the actions and decisions of one seemingly \"small\" person had an impact on that shocking day.\n\nThere were many heroes on the day that the towers fell -- many unacknowledged, unnamed and perhaps lost to the larger sweep of historical memory, but whose roles in the larger mosaic were crucial to saving more lives than we perhaps could ever quantify. \"The Suitcase\" acknowledges the moral urgency, duty and allegiance to community beyond the individual self at the core of these unnamed people, and asks us to reflect on how speaking up can have a resonance larger than we could ever initially conceive.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He must stay in the hospital and recover, as well as undergo occupational therapy to regain as much of his basic physical skills as possible.\n\nAngry and frustrated, Marquise struggles to reconcile his sense of self-worth with his new status as a paraplegic. But the journey to acceptance is hard, though with the help of his hospital roommate and his physical therapist, he begins to find his way.\n\nThis rich, expressive drama -- directed by Andrew Reid, and written by Reid and Roberto Saieh -- portrays one young man's transition from struggle to acceptance, as he navigates a \"new normal\" that is antithetical to the person he was, and wanted to be.\n\nThough it is far from bombastic, the film's visual approach and style isn't afraid to be striking or arresting, even expressionistic. This isn't a subtle, quiet film, but one that wears its emotions on its sleeve, reflecting the temperament and predicament of its main character. The lighting and colors are often rich and saturated, matching the heightened emotion of the film, and the camerawork is equally distinctive. Though most of the film is confined to the hospital setting, the richness of the images makes for a dynamic dramatic experience, matching Marquise's emotional arc.\n\n\"ASIA A\" refers to the classification given to Marquise, based on a system of tests developed by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). These tests -- based on how much sensation someone can feel at multiple points on the body, as well as the motor function -- define and describe the severity of a patient\u2019s spinal cord injury. The classification also helps determine future rehabilitation and recovery approaches.\n\nMarquise has the most severe grade, thanks to a complete lack of motor and sensory function below the level of his injury. \"Ballers\" actor London Brown nails Marquise's anger and frustration in a performance that's free of vanity: filled with anger and resentment, he's not afraid to lash out at the people who love or support him. But eventually he must face the truth -- not just the truth about his physical limitations, but his emotional reality as well. In doing so, he finds his true strength.\n\nSet to be developed as a feature with the help of the prestigious Tribeca Film Institute and Sloan Foundation, \"ASIA A\" is clearly a personal film.  Writer-director Reid became paralyzed from the chest down at age 21. Told by doctors that he would never walk again, Reid regained movement and today walks with a cane, continuing to progress in strength and health and going on to study in the MFA film program at USC.\n\n\"ASIA A\" serves as a valuable window into an experience not everyone may go through. But through the film's boldness and honesty, many will find it -- and its portrayal of struggle and strength to overcome a limitation -- inspiring and almost universal.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

His wife Luli takes her life just before he departs, leaving him bewildered and devastated.\n\nAt the morgue, he gets to use a special telephone booth to call back in time and talk to Luli. He gets to talk to her for five minutes but he cannot explicitly prevent her death. So he decides to call her right before she commits her final irrevocable act, in hopes that she will somehow change her mind. But as he tries desperately to connect with her emotionally and remind her of his love, he discovers what he has to say reveals more about himself than about her.\n\nThis meditative sci-fi short, directed by Shange Zhang and written by Nichole DeLaura, has a remarkable device that powers the story's main conceit, which is the ability to communicate with the dead one last time in the past. But the telephone booth here is the conduit for a much more tragic story of a troubled marriage endangered by years of neglect and heartbreak.\n\nWith such emotionally-harrowing narrative terrain, the writing emphasizes the psychological and the interior, particularly as they relate to relationships. The dialogue is incidental at first -- mostly pre-travel conversation on a phone, as the wife listens from the bathroom -- but much is communicated in the unspoken and the silence.\n\nThe visual style is somber, muted and subdued, but there is a precision and carefulness in the framing that emphasizes the almost abstract way Yucheng relates to his wife -- almost as if she's a fact of existence and not a person. In fact, the couple never shares a frame together, a salient artistic decision that says much about their relationship. Careful creative strategies like these emphasize the separateness of the pair, creating a lonely distance in the film's tone as well.\n\nThe performances of the film also stay within this quieter, subdued register, though both actors who play the couple -- Zhan Wang Yucheng and Eon Song as Luli -- deliver powerful moments of raw pain and anguish.  Yucheng occupies his section of the relationship with a busy indifference, barely noticing that he hasn't seen his wife before he leaves, but Luli experiences her marriage as isolating and alienating, leading to her final devastating act.\n\nThe narrative of \"The Five Minutes\" is in many ways an attempt at redemption, and a unique twist on stories that are essentially tragedies of miscommunication, especially those about what people waited too long to say. In the end, speaking from the heart is not necessarily something one does for the other person, especially if it's too little and too late. Communicating from the heart to someone you love is an act of grace, solace and care for yourself -- and frees yourself of the burden of regret and sorrow.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He's also a heavy drinker who's fond of giving his best friend Jeff a hard time.\n\nAfter one night out with his crew and many, many drinks, Alex woozily drives homes and catches sight of someone throwing a man off a bridge.\n\nIn his inebriated state, he believes it was Jeff who threw the man into the water below. But because he was drunk, he's not sure -- and his uncertainty forces him to question not just his friendship, but his sobriety.\n\nWriter-director Adam Linzey's short thriller is all about blurring lines: those between perception and reality, between intoxication and clarity and between friend and enemy. As its main character attempts to unravel a mystery he's ill-equipped to take on, he seems to set off a domino effect in his own life that causes him to question himself and his decisions.\n\nThe visuals are excellent at capturing a general sense of alienation, especially as the construction workers toil on roofs surrounded by the cityscapes around them, devoid of context and connection. It underscores that Alex is a stranger in a strange land -- and perhaps a stranger to himself.\n\nHis uneasiness within himself seems to manifest itself in his combative rapport with his friends, especially Jeff, a genial yet wary man who seems almost the opposite of Alex, with a stable family life and a sense of comfort with himself. The performances and writing are alert to the way these men talk and yet don't quite communicate with one another -- an opacity and gap that the storyline exploits to maximize tension and force Alex to question not just what happened, but himself. But as he penetrates deeper into the central mystery of the story, he is led into an even deeper void.\n\n\"Jeff\" combines the propulsive sense of craft and pacing that characterizes a thriller with a more brooding character portrait. The film is named after Alex's friend, but Alex's need to know and understand propels the forward motion of the narrative. The great irony is that the story underscores just how unknowable people can be -- both to others and to ourselves.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He wants to leverage his talent to move up in the world and impress the scouts checking him out for recruitment. But he's hampered at home by his bitter now-alcoholic father, Reggie, who was also a former basketball star.\n\nHis father is intensely jealous of his son's talent, and seeks to sabotage his prospects when the scout visits the family at home. When the visit goes awry and the ensuing fight becomes abusive, Demarkus decides to seek revenge.\n\nThis brooding family drama -- directed by Xavier Burgin from a script written by Tiara Marshall -- is about how trauma, anger and pain are transmitted between generations, and how the burdens and resentments of the past shape the choices and possibilities of the future. The background may be basketball, but the focus is on the fractious, difficult nature of family bonds beset by poverty, resentment and mistrust.\n\nThe throughlines of the film are cleanly established, with skillful writing deftly building character and motivation and offering just enough background for viewers to understand just what the stakes are for Demarkus. He's looking for a way out, and in many volatile, tense scenes, we see exactly why he's so desperate to escape from. The performances as a whole are thoroughly committed, and lead actors Mike Wade as Demarkus and Kent Faulcon as his father Reggie show just how dysfunctional yet intertwined this family is.\n\nMuch of the film is shrouded in shadows, with a moody, almost oppressive darkness that hangs heavily over much of the story. The look and feel is almost noirish, and when the action takes a darker, more violent turn, the visual approach suits the emotional tenor of the film well, especially as the conflict between father and son escalates and Demarkus makes a shocking choice that may endanger everything he's fought so hard to create for himself.\n\nA semifinalist at the 43rd Student Academy Awards, \"Olde E\" at its core about family and legacy, and how past generations' unresolved business -- and poverty and violence -- perpetuate themselves in a cycle.\n\nBreaking this cycle is beyond difficult and painful, and \"Olde E\" offers a perceptive and insightful look at just why cycles are so hard to shatter: why moving on and up can feel like abandonment to those still mired in the past, and how bitterness can rise to such venomous levels that it sabotages the usual parental desire to want what's best for a child. It's painful to watch, but with unflinching courage, the film forces us to take a closer, compassionate look at the emotional roots of generational violence and poverty, how deeply parents can damage their children -- and how part of growing up is learning to separate your self from your background and family legacy.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He's come home to his wife Rachel, but home feels strange -- the place feels different, and he also has a new baby, Amelia.\n\nBut the transition isn't easy, as he grapples phantom pain in his limbs, learning to use prosthetics and adjusting to his new life while trying to cope with his pre-war memories. Will grows increasingly isolated and full of despair, but through reconnecting with his loved ones and learning to accept his past and embrace his future, he finds his way.\n\nWriter-director Devon Manney's Student Academy Award-winning animated drama is a sensitive and introspective immersion into the difficult transition many veterans make after returning home. Many of them try to equalize towards a new normal, and must grapple with trying to \"catch up\" to a life that has gone on in their absence. But their psyches -- and very often their bodies -- also have been reshaped during their time away, making the adjustment even more difficult.\n\nWill's journey is steadily and gently delineated in the storytelling, each beat focused on his feelings of discombulation, struggle and emotional isolation. Will literally wants to reach out -- and in one scene, he wants to pick up his young daughter -- but the phantom pain he experiences is a significant barrier to overcome, forcing a wedge between himself and the people around him.\n\nThis phantom pain is economically yet powerfully rendered in the film's animation, making Will's inner experience visual and electric. In this sense, animation is the perfect medium to convey subjective and psychological experience, making the inner intrusions of Will's phantom pains into a palpable, outer-facing force that exerts itself, much to Will's detriment.\n\nThe visuals themselves have an elegant and evocating simplicity, paring down Will's story to its essentials and drawing powerful focus on the veteran's emotional experience. Combined with the relative realism of the sound design -- interpolated with electrical noise for Will's pain and well-placed use of a beautifully emotional score -- the result is a resonant, emotionally powerful experience that gets to the heart of Will's journey as he struggles to accept his new self, body and life, and find beauty and connection once again.\n\n\"Cradle\" -- which was also shortlisted for the Best Animated Short Oscar in 2017 -- is a showcase for animation's unique gifts as a medium, with its ability to engage the eye and evoke feeling and emotion with focus and economy, and the film's somber yet gentle style establishes the story's tone and approach to Will's story.\n\nWith empathy and compassion, the film offers a unique intimate look at what is often an alienating experience. But as Will eventually makes it to the other side, the ending is subtle, well-earned and resonant, because the audience knows just how much Will and veterans like him have struggled -- and how much seemingly small victories can feel like huge triumphs in the face of pain and suffering.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They're ready to embark on a new stage of life and figure out how to move forward with their lives.\n\nBut then their brother shows up with his fiance with a different plan for the house as executor of their mother's will. And his choice will force everyone to reckon with their current stage in life -- and the role they and their family played in it.\n\nWriter-director Leland Montgomery's domestic drama -- co-written with Tom Dugdale -- examines the push and pull of families themselves, and the tensions between being a refuge of familiarity and an emotional trap.\n\nShot against the stunning backdrop of the California desert, the film takes its time establishing the emotional atmosphere of the three sisters and their relationships with themselves and one another. There is a closeness, but that closeness can also seem cloistered, and each sister is eager to break out of their ruts.\n\nVisually, the film reflects this dichotomy with its visual approach. The cinematography leverages the dramatic beauty of its desert setting, bathing the images in a warm, almost halcyon glow. But within this glowing light are plenty of shadows and dark angles that also emphasize the sisters' emotional claustrophobia, particularly in how the house itself is shot and portrayed.\n\nSonically, there's also a dissonant, almost Western feel to the sound design and score that adds an artful element of discord and uneasiness to the film's subconscious, creating an undercurrent of gnawing tension.\n\nThe storytelling gains momentum when the brother enters the plot, injecting energy and outer-focused conflict into the more meditative proceedings. The drama comes to the surface, aided by great performances by the short's ensemble.\n\nActors Zoe Chao, Cass Bugge, Tera McHenry and Chris Aguila make for a believable group of siblings, able to telegraph a deep connection of shared history with an equally deep-lying alienation that spikes up in unexpected moments. When the brother reveals his plans for the house, the tension lines between them open up at long last, leading to a fierce confrontation and a spilling forth of the lingering resentments and disappointments that have built up.\n\n\"Like Animals\" is a restless film, both in style and feeling, mirroring the restlessness of the sisters who live in the house. Beyond its familial drama, it's also about what it means to feel stuck in life and a prisoner of our circumstances -- and confronting the ways our emotional patterns and past can imprison us as well\n\nThough the ending is resolutely open, \"Like Animals\" also offers the idea that true freedom comes from the inside. Or that the real relief isn't from being free, but from acceptance, and may come when we \"greet the world with love,\" as the film itself says. \"But what other option do we have?\" The question lingers well after the film's ending, teasing us as a query for reflection upon the ways we are trapped, or at least shaped by circumstances that aren't ours to control.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But his more traditional, stubborn father Sudhakar is opposed to the idea. And to complicate matters, the two men are still grappling with the recent death of the boy's mother, widening the gulf between them and heightening their grief.\n\nSudhakar sees his son as simply a rebellious teenager and doubts his son's maturity and commitment, while Akash chafes against this interpretation, instead of seeing himself as an artist who wants to be free. Tensions soon reach a breaking point, threatening to pull an already struggling family further apart.\n\nWriter-director Sohil Vaidya's beautifully affecting dramatic short is both a keenly observant, touching portrait of an evolving relationship between father and son, as the young son embraces the identity emerging within him and begins asserting his independence. It's also an engrossing, compact snapshot of India, where vibrant, energetic modernity rubs up against traditional ideas and mores and the constraints and requirements of the middle-class clash with an artist's yearning to explore the world.\n\nThese themes can be a lot for a short narrative to handle, but Vaidya's film balances them with a deceptively easy, light touch, helped along by a thoughtful yet sensuous approach to craftsmanship and a patient, sensitive storytelling voice. \n\nWhile the visuals are never \"show-offy\" or flamboyant, they are nevertheless textured, richly colored and simply beautiful to look at. The settings are especially evocative, from the warm yet time-worn furnishings of the family home to the gleaming surfaces of Akash's school. The cinematography and camera movement manage the trick of managing contrasts, being humble yet lush, and dynamic yet serene -- very apt for a film about clashing contrasts and ideas.\n\nThe narrative also takes its time to build the world and character of the father and son, and the performances of actors Abhay Mahajan and Chittaranjan Giri as son and father, respectively, showcase both the tensions and unspoken feelings of the pair, as well as their long, fraught yet loving history together.\n\nWhen tensions inevitably come to a head, what bubbles to the surface is not just the conflict at hand, but the submerged grief and loss they're both dealing with -- a sadness that offers both stubborn, opinionated men some common ground to forge a new understanding.\n\n\"Difficult People\" is a unique and soulful film, whose singular nature emerges gently but confidently as the story unfurls and builds to a subtle and moving ending. The short has a matter-of-fact, even offhand cultural specificity that captures an authentic sense of Mumbai, but at its heart, the arc concerns itself with an emotionally relatable, even universal, story about family, love, identity and independence. As the story of Akash and Sudhakar shows, the bonds of family and love can complicate the process of finding and asserting self. But the struggle to integrate both belonging and independence -- and the resulting understanding emerging from the effort -- is worth it.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

With him and his mother due to move soon, he has little time to get to the bottom of his disappearance.\n\nHe searches for answers among the laconic, hard-scrabble fishing community, and his investigation puts him in contact with a fisherman who is also haunted by the father's disappearance. The two come together to explore the unsettling rumors, putting them in confrontation with a darker presence they may not yet fully understand.\n\nImpeccably crafted with darkly luminous cinematography and a haunting sense of both dread and sadness, Ben Strang's \"Beast\" works on multiple levels, exploring a young man's investigation into the mystery of his family, identity and community as well as capturing a little-seen community fighting its own physical and socioeconomic erosion.\n\nTwo narrative modes service these two creative aims, intertwining to resonant effect in the storytelling. A brooding, uneasiness to the waters and town establishes right away that something strange is out there, and a poetic eye for naturalism finds beauty in the setting and place. Rendered with respect and even tenderness, the island setting is a character in the story, full of secrets and sadness. Yet the visual lyricism never comes at the expense of the pacing, which builds both Daniel's character and the disquieting tension that suffuses the film throughout.\n\nDaniel is played by young performer Elijah Mayo, who brings a watchful intelligence and a sense of aching responsibility to his portrayal that is entirely natural, grounded and understated. There isn't a lot of dialogue in the short, but the silences and unspoken sentiments suit a story that is about absence, sorrow and a grief that has nowhere to put itself. This lack of personal resolution drives Daniel to pursue the mystery of his dad's grief -- and sends him into the dark waters that took away his father in the first place.\n\n\"Beast\" essentially functions as the opening chapter of a larger world story, but it's an effective one in building a world, a larger question and a compelling atmosphere of setting and story. The disappearance of Daniel's father is beautifully fused with the fading fortunes of the small island on which he worked and lived, amplifying both his absence and the way it haunts his family and community.\n\nAs for the titular beast in question, spoiler alert: we don't quite discover what it is at the end of the story.

The five-star joint just about to close, but the diner stays open for him, serving him a meal, courtesy of Chef Paul and server Rita, who seems to take an interest in Devin.\n\nYet as the meal moves forward, the night gets weirder and weirder, as Paul and Rita reveal their odd idiosyncrasies -- and Devin takes on more than he bargains for.\n\nWriter-director Khaled Ridgeway's horror short fits into the recent, highly popular strand of socially engaged horror, where the genre norms and conventions -- and the supreme entertainment value of thrill and suspense -- are leveraged to explore the almost primal traumas of issues like racism, sexism and other systems of inequality and oppression.\n\nThese explorations aren't subtle, but that's the point in films like this: their intense emotional effects and imaginative audacity are meant to make viewers squirm about the cruel, cavalier and horrific ways society and history have historically treated Black bodies.\n\nLike many genre films, the film has a masterful command of craft, able to imbue the surfaces and sounds of everyday Americana into something loaded with menace, slowly ratcheting up the tension and weirdness. Its strength is its ability to slowly but confidently create a pocket of a parallel universe that feels sealed-off and immune from the outside world: time seems to pass differently, and people act just a little off. The lurid nighttime cinematography, the off-kilter sound design and uncanny rhythms of its editing make certain details of the world acquire strange weight and significance, one that Devin seems blithely oblivious to at first, focused as he is on his meal and his phone.\n\nActor Yves Beneche plays the relatable point of normality for the audience with an easy affability, just a young Yelper in search of a good meal to review, while Tisha Terrasini Banker and Paul Mischeshin calibrate their performances wonderfully, at first seeming just a bit odd and eccentric. But as the film escalates its tension, they reveal just what makes this night diner so special.\n\nWith a clever combination of stylized craftsmanship and a willingness to hold nothing back, \"Night Diner\" subverts the beloved iconic symbol of the all-American diner, which often represents a humble, generally working-class place where communities gather in an egalitarian way, stopping for a respite before getting on with the business of life.\n\nBut \"Night Diner\" rips open the underbelly of this particular slice of Americana, showing the messy history and dark legacies that often undergird classic, seemingly innocuous institutions. The symbolism and impact aren't subtle, but horror rarely is, instead choosing to parlay the feeling of being sick to our stomachs into thought-provoking critique -- and a visceral understanding of how it feels to be brutalized and powerless in an incomprehensible world.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Intersex and estranged from his family, he tries his best to find a sense of belonging, tenderness and affection within a lonely, seedy life. Too often, though, he has to tolerate cruelty and callousness to settle for scraps of attention.\n\nOne night, though, a mysterious man enters the laundromat. He's the strong and silent type, but also kind and attentive -- and a strange, fairytale-like encounter with him helps Ponyboi confront his deepest fears and sadness, and realize he's worth more than what he is settling for.\n\nCombining the seediness of the Jersey boardwalk with a core of tender romanticism, writer and lead actor River Gallo's gritty yet enchanting short drama -- directed by Sade Clacken Joseph and River Gallo and executive produced by Stephen Fry, Emma Thompson and Seven Graham -- feels very much like a queer, magical-realist riff on a Bruce Springsteen ballad. It takes the codes and symbolism of a certain strain of nostalgic working-class Americana and spins it into poetic, audacious, and unexpected directions, creating a moving paean to self-love, courage and imagination.\n\nThe visual baseline is a certain kind of gritty naturalism, reminiscent of American indie directors like Gus Van Sant or Allison Anders, but it's gently stylized as well, as painful scenes of Ponyboi's life blending into dreamy, melancholy dreamscapes, complete with graceful camerawork and a muted, melancholy palette. In many ways, the craftsmanship in and of itself possesses a striking, subversive androgyny, especially as it takes usually masculine tropes and reframed them within a dreamy fairytale-like lens.\n\nThe form deftly reflects the themes explored in the storytelling, which touches upon little-explored terrain in popular culture. Ponyboi's story is a relatable one about standing for your self-worth, but it can't help but be impacted by growing up intersex in a world governed by rigid norms. The plot lightly touched upon the challenges that a young Ponyboi faced and their connection to his current situation, but the focus emotionally is on his internal journey, which is powerfully portrayed by Gallo themselves in the titular role.\n\nAs Ponyboi comes to realize the gap between the limitations of his life and the yearnings of his heart, he must confront the core question of what he himself believes he deserves, having internalized the messages of rejection and dehumanization he's faced all his life. By exploring the fullness of his dreams and opening up to being fully seen, heard and cherished, he is finally able to love and value himself and find a path to healing.\n\nWith an extensive and highly acclaimed festival run under its belt, \"Ponyboi\" has the distinction of being the first narrative film by and about an intersex individual, which is a historical achievement in and of itself. And while this focus is an integral part of its creative DNA, it's also a finely wrought, beautifully crafted story about finding self-love and self-acceptance.\n\nThrough its powerful openheartedness and vulnerability, it's a beautiful, even rhapsodic piece of art that transports viewers into a warm embrace of self-acceptance alongside its main character. We all have deep, broken places within ourselves, and hope and healing can be found with a radical acceptance of who we are and what we truly want -- and the bravery to stand for that, and refuse to settle for anything less.\n\nTo learn more about how you can advocate for Intersex rights and awareness visit http://interactadvocates.org.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

After spending much of his life creating the Mongol Empire, he finds himself somewhere in Eurasia during the medieval era, looking for more plunder and conquests.\n\nSeeking one more frontier, he encounters a golden telescope during one ransacking. He mistakes it for a magical weapon, but the wizard who created it tells him it's only for looking and invites the legendary warrior to peer through it, where Genghis beholds the moon's Sea of Tranquility. Then in a final fit, Genghis drinks from the wizard's potions -- and finds himself on a quest he never expected.\n\nThis ambitious, gorgeously realized sci-fi adventure short, by director Kerry Yang and writer Steve Emmons, is packed with stunning vistas, considerable technical prowess, suspenseful pacing and dazzling images that draw marvel and wonder from viewers. But it also has a genuine metaphysical streak that leverages the epic scale of the visuals to provoke a sense of the mystical and spiritual.\n\nThe initial spirit of the craftsmanship harkens back to great adventure films like the Indiana Jones franchise, with a  swashbuckling sense of rhythm and an almost puckish sense of playfulness. Every element comprising the film's sense of craft is superlative, from the beautifully sculpted moonscapes to the compelling performances by veteran actors James Hong and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa to the sound design and score.\n\nWatching Genghis push himself to find just one more thing to conquer is pure cinematic fun, complete with a rollicking playfulness characteristic of the golden age of B-movies with the production values and artistic accomplishment of a prestige picture. But as the story unfolds and enters into the sci-fi realm, it takes on a true auteurist eccentricity and explores a more idiosyncratic direction in the plot, giving Genghis unexpected shadings as a character and a symbol.\n\nTaking a larger than life legendary historical figure like Genghis Khan out of his earthly context and into the vacuum of space deconstructs his legacy, most especially his thirst to conquer. Who is Genghis Kehn, then, when there is nowhere else for him to dominate? He must then confront himself, as well as the notion of his own mortality -- for death is the frontier that no man can ever conquer, no matter who he is.\n\nWildly entertaining, unique and oddly resonant, \"Genghis Khan Conquers the Moon\" uses its epic scale not just to provoke enjoyment, but to foster a sense of humanity's smallness. When faced with the endless deep of space, even a man of Genghis's renown shrinks to become a mere speck. We cannot help but question man's innate striving in the face of the great eternity of the universe, which renders everything insignificant in the end.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

On the way, they are aided and guided by three curious, mystical desert creatures, who imbue the journey with magic and just a little menace. \n\nBut all the magic in the world cannot disguise the fact that their journey is a dangerous one, and that Maria and Juan's father, and the children who follow him, are in grave peril as they race across the desert at night.\n\nEqual parts whimsical, charming and powerfully emotional, this children's fantasy short -- written and directed by Christian Contreras and Victoria De La Torre -- from pulls in magical realism, live-action puppetry and enchanting storytelling to offer a unique slant on a very grown-up issue. \n\nIts heritage clearly draws upon the classics of children's fables, offering up a plucky, resourceful main character who must adventure into the unknown. But the innovative script injects those tropes with the often overlooked experience of child immigrants, who are equally as powered by a deep longing to be with the people they belong to. Maria and Juan's driving desire is to find their father, and their quest drives them into the darkness of the desert at night.\n\nAs a fantasy fable, the craftsmanship adds a look and feel to the film that is both earthily naturalistic and vividly imaginative.  The beautifully rich cinematography captures both the textured, rough-hewn world that the children live in, as well as the expressionistic, almost mythic nighttime desert. \n\nWithin both these worlds, the charming puppets that make up the small cadre of mystical desert creatures fit in perfectly. Artfully imagined and rendered, these aren't cute adorable sidekicks familiar to children's television, but instead have a shrewdness and uncanniness that helps the story and characters explore the darker, scarier emotions that arise. As they progress in the story and face ever higher stakes, Maria and Juan will need all the help and guidance they can muster as it becomes clear just what they're facing.\n\nLike the great stories of children's literature, \"Para Ellos\" doesn't shy from difficult terrain. It leverages the rich imagination and emotional directness of kids to train a new lens onto the fraught topic of immigration. In doing so, it frames the experience of children like Maria and Juan at the center, and doesn't anesthetize or downplay the sadder events of the story. Instead, the frame of the children's fable reminds us just what is at stake during these dangerous journeys, and just what a tragedy it is to keep families apart.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Unable to deal with their grief, the family grew apart.\n\nIn the 10 years since her mom's death, Lita has grown into a headstrong young woman. But she has never forgotten the promise she made to her mother to bring the family together, no matter what, to watch the orbit of the Eros Comet. When the comet's time has come, Lita decides to fulfill her mother's promise and bring everyone together -- even if she has to resort to kidnapping.\n\nWriter-director Jon Sahagian's sci-fi family drama has a mischievous spirit, an ultra-cute robot and a sense of infectious fun that harkens back to Steven Spielberg's films of the 1980s. The storytelling is always moving, there's often a whimsical touch in each scene and each beat leads to an emotional core of family, togetherness and love.\n\nThere's a heightened quality to many aspects of the filmmaking, from the quippy writing to the action set pieces nestled into the plotline, ranging from car chases to breakouts. These make the film undeniably fun, giving it an effervescence that's contagious. \n\nYet the central storyline is really about what it means to be a family. Lita has a fixed idea of what being a family looks like and wants to fulfill that above everything. She has the will and the means to make what she wants to happen, yet when it does, it doesn't fulfill the underlying feelings of grief and sadness it's meant to assuage. Instead, she has to accept not just the reality of her mother's absence, but where each member of her family is at emotionally. Once she's able to accept the reality of her family, though, her family can finally come together.\n\nSweet, sharp and undeniably entertaining, \"The Star of Eros\" possesses an almost childlike joy in its revelry of craft and a heartwarming sweetness at its core that gives the film its warmth and resonance. Its craft and storytelling is excellent all around, but it's really its sincerity of feeling -- and its great big heart -- that makes the film such a resonant pleasure to watch, and a reminder of what's truly important in life.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But when her family is taken away by German soldiers, she joins the Soviet resistance, where she is immersed in the horrors of war.\n\nWhen a soldier dies in her car, carrying a photograph, she remembers her recent past, where she pursued her passion for photography, which was also the family business. But her talent was hijacked by the Nazis that took away her family -- and in order to keep them alive, she has do what she is ordered.\n\nBut when she uncovers visual evidence of what happened to her family -- and others who share her Jewish faith -- she realizes that she cannot work for the Nazis anymore and escapes. Though she would like to forget what happened, she realizes the power of what she has and the talent she possesses and uses it to document the story of her people and their struggle.\n\nWritten and directed by Caroline Friend, this powerful historical short drama is a richly compelling narrative is told with a sweeping sense of craft and storytelling. Based on the true story of Faye Schulman, who was the only photographer to document the Jews' struggle in Eastern Europe during World War II, it transports viewers back into a chapter of history whose lessons remain sadly relevant, even today.\n\nRich with shadows and color, the film is undeniably handsome in look and feel, as fitting its artistic main character. But instead of looking nostalgic, its beauty never detracts away from the difficult subject matter, and its visual dynamism, particularly in the camera movement and editing, give it resolutely modern pacing and sense of constant discovery and suspense, driven by Faye's discovery of the full extent of Nazi persecution.\n\nThe storytelling is more complex than typical for a short, spanning multiple time periods and locations, and in many ways, it feels as if a feature-length story has been folded into the short timeframe. But the throughlines and relationships are established with clarity, and the characters are brought to life by a series of fine performances, particularly by lead actor Kally Khourshid in the role of Faye, who must balance the poles of love, loyalty and devastation. Her photography was abused by the Nazis as a weapon in their wartime apparatus, and it also is a potently emotional and painful reminder of her family. But she also remembers just how powerful photographs can be, and re-embraces that part of herself in service of a bigger cause.\n\nWhen finally revealed, the full scope of the story's events has a powerful resonance, not just because it is grounded in historical reality, but in its themes of memory, documentation and keeping alive the lessons of past generations. We would like to think that the atrocities of the past will remain in the dustbins of history, but sadly the enmities that Hitler and the Nazis exploited to rise to power still exist today. Faye Schulman's story and its powerful telling in \"Under Darkness\" reminds us not to forget the Holocaust. But it also reminds us that people found hope and meaning in the struggle and resistance against oppression, hate and evil -- something that remains true for many today.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

When informed by the school of what Emme has done, her parents force her to admit the kiss was a mistake, making the her sad and uncertain.\n\nMeanwhile, the Grand High Council of Fairy Tale Rules and Standards is dealing with an errant narrator, Hammond, who insists on altering his tales to offer the children who read them the true lessons they need. Hammond is assigned Emme's case and told he must narrate the story exactly as it is written or else risks losing his magical tongue, which gives him the ability to speak.\n\nDelightful and surprising, this immensely charming fantasy short -- directed by Ali Scher from a script co-written by Scher and Joe Swanson -- possesses the traditional components of the fairy tale film: a fair maiden, a knight, a fairy godmother all play significant roles in the story, and there's even a musical number. But with irreverent, zany wit and a great dose of compassion, it subverts those conventions to fashion a more inclusive and terrifically funny story for a modern age, keeping the pleasures of the genre while both deepening and broadening them.\n\nThe film possesses an unusually wide-ranging narrative structure for a short, incorporating and intersecting two characters' stories and a tale-within-a-tale while uniting both with almost Monty Pythonesque touches and deadpan one-liners. Similarly, its stylistic palette is adventurous and free-wheeling, rendering Emme's more realistic story with mannerist touches similar to early Wes Anderson and juxtaposing it with the more classical fantasy world of Hammond's story, with its rich shadows and vivid saturated colors.\n\nWith such creative ambition and risk-taking, the film could easily over-extend itself, but it deftly balances its rich layers with a clear sense of mission, never losing sight of Emme's story and her needs as a character. All elements of the craft, storytelling and world-building are geared to offer Emme, via Hammond's narrative aims, a story to affirm who she is and restore her sense of wholeness and authenticity.\n\nBy being coerced to label her kiss as an accident, she is forced to disown herself from her own truth. It's the first crack in her sense of self, and actor Tallulah Wayman-Harris's performance subtly captures this initial flicker of doubt and uncertainty, shading it with sadness and hinting at how it can widen into deeper inner chasms of self-alienation. Actor David Anders, who plays Hammond, ably balances the demands of a more heightened and stylized fantasy performance with the emotional clarity of a caring grown-up figure -- one who sees his charge struggling, and knows what she needs to restore her confidence and sense of being comfortable in her own skin.\n\nLike the best children's stories, \"The Maiden and the Princess\" -- which also features a performance by veteran actor Julian Sands and a vocal appearance by Megan Hilty -- balances quick-witted and quick-moving fun with a certain emotional coherence. The themes are unusually multi-layered and variegated, with much to say about being the author of one's own story and celebrating inclusivity and difference.\n\nThe film is able to balance many themes because it never loses sight of just why storytelling is so important, especially at an early age. Like the best of storytelling for children, it holds the different poles of moral clarity and humanist complexity at the same time and recognizes that for many, stories sometimes allow us space for our innermost selves to be seen and heard, and accepted for what we are. When Emme's narrative concludes with a triumphant reclaiming of her story, it's not unlike the ways we learn to reclaim the lost parts of ourselves, in all their rightness and truth.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Clearly, frustrated, he tells her no. Meanwhile, the Richard arrives in a speedy car. He walks into the kitchen, grabs some baklava and makes some small talk.\n\nRichard tells Nick all he thinks about now is death.\n\nNick wants Richard to help take care of mom on nights. When Richard suggests they put her in a nursing home, Nick furiously rejects the idea. If Richard won't take care of her, he'll need to break it to her.\n\nRichard brings some tea to the living room, while Nick vacuums. Mom wants them to get along, angering Nick, who sucks up everything in the room -- including Richard.\n\nLater, as Nick irons the sheets, he overhears mom complaining to a friend that he doesn't work and lacks Richard's drive. Nick slams the tray on the table, scaring them. Upset, he yells at mom for being unappreciative. She tells him it's not a competition.\n\nHe calms down and pours them some tea.\n\nNick goes to take a shower. But shortly after turning on the water, he hears mom calling for help. He rushes out and calls the doctor.\n\nAs the doctor enters the living room, Richard asks if mom has a twisted stomach. Nick asks if it's constipation. The doctor says they'll need to clean her up. Then, Richard thanks him for coming and walks him out. Nick turns off the light in the living room and tends to mom.\n\nMom apologizes for making a mess and Nick tells her it's okay and he loves her.\n\nDays pass and Nick and Richard take turns caring for mom.\n\nOne day, Richard calls Nick to say mom has passed away. Nick asks if Richard left her bedside -- Richard says he only popped out for a few minutes and drove straight back. He swears he was with her, held her hand and told her he loved her.\n\nRichard tells Nick he's with her now. After he hangs up, he breaks down in tears holding mom's lifeless body.\n\nThe brothers are back at home, pack up mom's belongings. Richard pauses for a moment and Nick asks what he's looking at. To which, he replies, \"death.\"\n\nThey stare quietly before sharing a moment of laughter. Then, Nick suggests they both get on.\n\nJacobs was motivated to make the film after seeing the death of her grandma to Parkinson's disease.

But because she's young, the people in charge won't let her into the morgue, due to the fact that she has no ID.\n\nShe faces great obstacles as she tries to navigate the opaque layers of policies and bureaucracy in order to identify the body. She has no uncle, grandfather or father to accompany her or vouch for her.\n\nBut after much begging and pleading, the receptionist finally allows her to go back. But when she finally gets a private moment with the body, the young girl has more on her mind than simply saying goodbye, as a whole other layer of action and meaning unfolds.\n\nWriter-director Alireza Ghasemi's short drama from Iran is a powerful, incisive examination of the harsh realities faced by young girls in this society. When faced with a difficult yet common situation, the main character isn't regarded as an autonomous human being. Even though she's young and without an ID, she constantly faces dismissal at the most fundamental levels because she's not accompanied by a man who can vouch for her.\n\nThe storytelling uses naturalistic camerawork and intelligent, realistic writing to embed this assumption deep within the societal obstacles she faces. This insidious idea undergirds how various people talk to the young girl, and their assumptions of what she should and shouldn't do form the biggest obstacle to her needs.\n\nThe dialogue works realistically to portray this, delivered with understated, subtle nuance and precision by a uniformly excellent cast. The characters don't deliver messages or speak from soapboxes -- they're simply doing their jobs, armed with an understanding of what is or isn't appropriate for a young woman. The young girl must constantly butt up against their attitudes. And as a result, the frustration she experiences is completely understandable, and empathetic viewers feel her helplessness as their own.\n\nThe film's initial half works as a powerful social document in many ways, powerfully yoking attitudes about women to the obstacles faced by the young girl.\n\nHowever, as the second half unfolds, the film gains a new layer of plot, creating suspense and tension that is almost thriller-like in its ability to draw in viewers with narrative questions so intriguing that they demand answers. By delving into the darker underside of the young girl's situation -- one that isn't fully elucidated until a revealing conversation at the film's end -- we get a darker, more insidious look at how young women are controlled in this society.\n\nAn audience and jury favorite at Cannes, \"Lunch Time\" is like a Moebius strip of a narrative, in which one story is built up, only to be twisted in an entirely new direction. The deceptively simple narrative structure and writing reveal themselves to be much more sophisticated and sly, as it constructs one picture and then upends itself to illuminate a thornier, more complicated picture.\n\nYet the unifying thread is a powerful portrayal of control and domination, achieved on multiple levels. The young girl faces it not only at the bureaucratic, institutional level, but in a more personal, intimate way -- which makes imagining her escape all the more difficult. The lack of true freedom is simply everywhere the young girl goes, shadowing everything she is able to do or not do, making its influence all the more pervasive and felt.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The two seem to connect, and Tommy helps Charlotte to escape her isolation and loneliness. But during one misadventure at night, Tommy betrays Charlotte, underscoring just how alone she is in the world. Charlotte then must make a choice, deciding what's truly important to her.\n\nWriter-director Jamie Dack's evocative short drama subtly evokes the awkward, tentative yet fierce longing for connection in this exploration of adolescent romantic intrigue, desire and loneliness.\n\nThe scope of the short, which premiered at Cannes, is firmly focused on Charlotte, establishing the emptiness of her small, mundane world. Using very little dialogue, the film's camerawork and sound design captures the quotidian textures and sounds surrounding Charlotte, with a poetic eye and ear for precise, striking detail, from the panting of a dog to the bareness of her front yard.\n\nThe setting could seemingly be anywhere in suburban America, and many other young people ravenous for experience and meaning, Charlotte feels adrift and unrooted in this seemingly sunny world. One of the most intriguing shots of the film -- of Charlotte listlessly pushing at her dinner as a glimpse of a family member fills the background -- is seemingly one of the most random, and yet it says so much about Charlotte's life, and how she feels marginal and untethered even in her own home.\n\nWhen Tommy enters the picture, however, viewers see instantly how he -- and the possibility of attraction -- add a frisson of excitement to Charlotte's life, which seems to spark a more adventurous and open side to her character. Charlotte isn't passive or even afraid, revealing herself as someone who grasps at the opportunities in front of her. She takes a risk, and initiates a more sustained encounter with Tommy, which unfurls a beautifully hopeful revelation from her. But despite her shy bravura, she still finds herself in a situation out of her control -- and faced with the bald truth of Tommy's character.\n\nBeautiful and powerfully sad at the same time, \"Palm Trees and Power Lines\" takes a classic coming-of-age narrative and subtly spins it into a snapshot of one girl trying to find an anchor in a transient, disconnected world. The performances by Alyssa Latson and Philip Alexander as Charlotte and Tommy, respectively, are perfectly calibrated towards understatement, almost as if they're two people floating in the currents of life who have casually bumped into one another, and may keep each other company until another current pulls them in different directions.\n\nIt's a portrayal of human relations that emphasizes how provisional and almost haphazard relationships can be, and how fragile they are when it comes to alleviating our fundamental aloneness in life. And yet -- as Charlotte discovers -- that void of loneliness is so strong and pervasive that we often grasp at them anyway, despite knowing how weak they may be at their core.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

It doesn't help that his dad is the school's janitor, either, who picks up his son in a rickety old car every day.\n\nBut George's dad decides to stand up for his kid, showing just how far a parent will go to love and support their child -- even if it means possible further humiliation.\n\nDirector Andrew Mudge has crafted a sweet, delightful dramedy full of genuine heart and compassion. Its charming quirks -- minimal dialogue for the main characters, soaring score and meticulous and witty production design -- never overwhelm the film.\n\n\"The Perfect Gooseys\" wears its sincerity and emotion proudly, earning every second of its touching finale -- and reminding us what really matters when it comes to what teach our families.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Being yourself is even harder.\n\nOverweight, shy and introverted, Ari wants nothing more than to fit in. He develops a crush on his fellow student, Jess, and attempts to lose weight and become more outgoing in his quest to belong.\n\nBut his efforts only cause him more humiliation and pain, making him feel even lonelier and sadder. Finally, he makes a public declaration of his own self-acceptance -- and discovers his own value.\n\nThis touching coming-of-age short touches on universal themes and common experiences that have been mined before, but director Alex Murawski offers a fresh, engaging take on the genre, capturing Ari's story with beautifully precise camerawork and well-honed performances. They bring to life a well-crafted script that underplays the emotions without ever undercutting them, and the result is a film that is still sensitive and avoids melodrama.\n\n\"Ari\" immerses the viewer in the main character's inner life, truly allowing audiences to inhabit his existence and open up a wellspring of compassion. Self-acceptance and the courage to be yourself are universal themes, but Ari's final actions in the film are surprisingly thought-provoking and heartwarming -- and will have you smiling to yourself at the end.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But doing it may mean losing her friendships with the boys she calls her friends.\n\nWriter-director Greta Nash's short, searing drama tackles a very current issue, but from a unique perspective: rather than looking at it from the POV of a perpetrator or a survivor, the story looks at sexual harassment and discrimination from the role of the bystander.\n\nBut with its taut, focused yet emotionally complex script and beautifully sensitive camerawork, Nash's film looks at this hot-button topic with great intelligence and subtlety. Carla is a fully realized character, who feels a clear rapport with her male friends. Among these friends, she feels she belongs and is respected, although that dynamic may be changing, especially as they get deeper into adolescence and the hormones begin to kick in.\n\nBut when she discovers the secret chat, she realizes that whatever egalitarianism and acceptance she may feel could be an illusion -- and her gender may indeed exclude her in both subtle and powerful ways in the future, especially as boys become men and girls become women, complete with social roles and expectations. She begins to wonder why the boys don't sexualize her, but she also feels uneasy and \"gross,\" as she says, about what's happening. The performances of the young cast, especially by lead performer Bridie Noonan, are sensitively rendered and well done, and take care not to demonize or idealize any position.\n\nHow Carla navigates her discovery poses powerful questions about how gender and power work in the most emotional and intimate ways -- not just in the realm of romance, but in our search for belonging, connection and finding a place in the world where we feel respected, seen, heard and understood. Carla carries a heavy burden -- she knows what the right thing to do was, but she risks ostracization from the group of friends she values most. The film doesn't at all flatten her concerns, and makes clear the costs of what choice Carla eventually makes.\n\n\"Locker Room\" is powerful, thought-provoking and memorable because, in some sense, we are all bystanders in this era of awareness -- and often must weigh the costs of speaking up vs. staying silent. Through the lens of one character's journey, we understand the small and insidious ways that oppression and domination work, especially in the realm of everyday life and emotion. In the end, the conclusion of the film is both deeply sad, subtly dark but also quietly hopeful -- much like a lot of discussion that surrounds the film's issues in general.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He gets caught up in their game, playing alongside the kids as they venture into the woods surrounding their neighborhood.\n\nBut as Max loses his grip on his reality, the game of pretend suddenly feels altogether too real -- and the two young boys lose their innocence.\n\nDirector Christian van Duuren has crafted a powerful exploration of the effects that warfare has on the psyche, combining excellent camerawork and finely calibrated performances to delve deep into one man's brief descent into darkness.\n\nThe film begins on a light enough note, as a grown man joins a game played by two young boys. It seems innocent, though small moments of dissonance offer some sense of underlying unease. But as the film progresses, it transitions into something altogether taut, dark and tense, and the tonal shift is absolutely seamless.\n\nThe hand-held camera seems edgier and more nervous, and the superlative sound design captures the memories haunting Max effectively, evoking the harshness of the battlefield in the middle of a quiet, tranquil wooded area.\n\nThe performances are subtle and excellent all around, and both adult and children find perfectly specific moments to communicate their fear -- and the realization that this game is not just child's play anymore, but something much darker and complicated.\n\n\"Gamechanger\" is a haunting and tense portrayal of the very human cost of warfare, whose images and emotional moments will linger with viewers well after viewing -- much like the invisible scars than many in the military struggle with, long after their battlefield days are over.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Andy jokes about her figure while eating a plate of ribs. When the waitress mentions the ribs \"fall off the bone and melts in the mouth,\" she adds a well-timed \"that's what she said.\"\n\nJake begins to feel comfortable with Andy and has the courage to tell more provocative jokes. He starts by talking religion and works his way up to Jesus. Andy laughs.\n\nFinally, Jake asks how people know Adam and Eve weren't Black. When the punchline hits, Andy takes offense to the stereotype.\n\nAn awkward silence.\n\nJake think the joke is dinner appropriate, considering she ordered ribs. But Andy calls it a racist joke.\n\nJake tries to smooth it over and Andy let's it slide. But then, Jake makes one more joke about his shadow being black and Andy gets upset.\n\nThe bill comes and Andy insists on going dutch. She tell him there won't be a second date and they hurriedly leave the restaurant.\n\nOutside, a Black man approaches Andy. She tells him she doesn't have any money to give him. But he says he's not asking for money -- his Uber dropped him off at the wrong place and he's looking for directions to his DJ gig.\n\nAndy is speechless.\n\nJake has been listening and steps in to give directions. Then, he turns to Andy, gives her one last look and leaves.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But the head coach of the team is skeptical and even hostile, even after A.J. offers a convincing display of his talents and ability.\n\nBut Coach Moss offers A.J. one last test to prove his mental toughness and mettle. But the dangerous, even cruel, trial may find A.J. sacrificing a crucial part of himself, all in the name of moving up in his sport.\n\nDirector Verner Maldonado, with Matthew Schlissel, is a compact, powerfully plotted drama that takes advantage of its tight narrative scope to ratchet up tension and suspense. A pressure cooker of a sports story, the film uses beautifully naturalistic but dynamic camerawork (including fantastic underwater footage) and brisk editing to capture the course of one swim practice, creating the sense of a sealed-off world with rules and laws of its own.\n\nThe story starts right away in confrontation mode, as A.J. demands a trial to get onto the team. Beyond his undeniable talent, he also shows great chutzpah and initiative. His coach, however, doesn't take kindly to it, increasing his ire towards A.J.\n\nThe vivid, concise writing and excellent performances by actors Charles Parnell as Coach Moss and Michael Blake Kruse as A.J. bring precision to each specific beat of the growing conflict, as well A.J.'s growing conflicted emotions as he progresses in his testing. He arcs from being confident and even cocky, but when faced with one last trial, his youth reveals itself as an innocence in danger of tarnishing.\n\nHis final test is clearly a hazing of sorts, and A.J. is faced with a difficult choice: will he go through with it to follow his ambitions, or will he follow his conscience? The confluence of strong writing, a subtle but tense score and nuanced performances drive the film to A.J.'s answer, and its ending is both a turning point in A.J.'s life and his sense of self -- and something that will linger with audiences, well after the film's ending.\n\n\"Swim\" is a sports drama in the best sense of the term, using the naturally heightened and often overt conflict of athletics to explore character, ethics and emotion. Ultimately a dark meditation on the price of success and perhaps even passion, as well as a cinematic Polaroid of one young man learning just who he is, and perhaps confronting the darker side of his character for the first time. A.J. is young and driven, but also innocent of just what it takes to pursue success in an ultra-competitive world.\n\nWhen the proverbial veil is ripped from his eyes, the cost of just what it may take -- and who he must become -- becomes known, with an almost devastating clarity.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He's struggled with emotional barriers and insecurities with his physical image since being badly scarred, and losing both of his arms in a fire. Yet he's put himself out there after many years of recovering, in hopes of making a romantic connection.\n\nHis date with Caleb seems promising, and the pair head back to Sean's place. But just when things seem to be progressing, Sean's insecurities flare up and take the evening in an unexpected direction.\n\nDirector Sherren Lee and writer Jesse LaVercombe have crafted a warmly empathetic romantic drama about learning to open up to another person in a vulnerable situation and offering compassion to someone just when they need it the most.\n\nThe narrative approach and scale is a classic two-hander in many ways, featuring two people and their strong emotions in a confined setting. Crafted with a solid, steady sense of intimacy, it's heavy on excellent dialogue like many two-handers, especially as its two characters negotiate a tricky, delicate situation.\n\nWhat makes the film highly unique, though, is the main character and actor, and an unusual level of specificity and honesty about his initially defining traits. Actor Prince Amponsah was caught in an apartment fire in 2012, and took years to recover after burns covered over half his body. Amponsah returned to acting four years later, and LaVercombe's script -- which is loosely based on the writer's first encounter with Amponsah -- is a lovely tribute to the process of recovery and how difficult it was to return to some semblance of a full life after such a life-altering accident.\n\nBut while the onscreen chemistry between Amponsah and LaVercombe is very connected and open and both actors offer authentic, affecting performances, the film's power isn't in replicating a true-life story in a fictional setting. Instead, with careful, compassionate emotional honesty and understatement, the film extracts a sense of universality from a highly specific character, and when Sean experiences intense vulnerability just as he's on the verge of an intimacy he both fears and desires, the dynamic is highly relatable, both in how it plays out and the tenderhearted way it's resolved.\n\n\"The Things You Think I'm Thinking\" offers a full emotional experience about a character we don't often see, but its resonance is in its story and core emotions. At its heart, the narrative is about how we often project the shame and uncertainty we feel about ourselves out into the world, letting these color and shape our interactions and experience, especially in situations like first dates where we are afraid of being judged despite all our best efforts.\n\nYet sometimes, though, we meet those who are able to be honest -- sometimes painfully so -- and patient in the face of those defenses. In those moments of openness and authenticity, we can grow in empathy and self-awareness -- and offer one another the ordinary yet wonderful miracle of mutual understanding.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Called Furlong, it's where teens go to jump off cliffs into a pool of water below.\n\nAs they bike to the spot together, Abbey has a fascination with her brother's best friend, who also seems to see her in a new light. But when a flirtatious gambit goes wrong, an initially innocent outing takes a darker, murkier turn.\n\nWriter-director Adam Meeks, along with co-writer Sophie Brooks, has crafted a short drama whose idyllic surfaces and observant sense of naturalism belie a dramatic shift in one teen's experience of self and her place in the world.\n\nVisually the film is both peaceable and lush, mostly taking place in a setting rich with beautiful greenery, mountains and nature, all of which are captured in crystalline cinematography. As the group of teens escapes into this mountain paradise, it gives the story the poetic sense of a sealed-off corner of the world, where anything can happen and any rules can be made up as they go along.\n\nIt also allows for the storytelling to unfold with a sense of patience and subtlety, driven as it is by the undercurrents of desire, curiosity and fascination between two people who are starting to see one another in a new light. The film's dialogue is almost minimal, focused as it is on the unspoken expressions and body language between Abbey and Sam.\n\nThe excellent writing and acting show a precise care paid to the unspoken flickers of feelings shaping and driving behavior, particularly in teenagers who are grappling with strong unruly desires --without the seasoned judgment of grown-up experience. When Sam flirtatiously tries to get Abbey to jump off the cliff -- with disastrous results -- it forces her to deal with her worst fears in a high-pressure way no one anticipated on a beautiful summer day.\n\nMany films about teenagers focus on a set of experiences marking adulthood -- first love, losing virginity, acts of rebellion -- and \"Furlong\" initially seems to follow this tradition at the beginning. But it sidesteps its way to a more suspenseful, interesting way of exploring the passage to maturity, coming through with an examination of what happens when we confront the edges of mortality and fear, and come through to the other side.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Dad walks in and takes a look, then tells her to clean up. He continues to look in the newspaper for part-time jobs.\n\nDad stares at the painting, then runs the shower and sits in the tub. They eat instant noodles for dinner.\n\nThe next morning, the little girl plays with her dad's lighter. Dad hears the smoke alarm go off and run to grab her and take her outside.\n\nThen, he runs into the fire, his daughter screaming for him to come back.\n\nThe next day, their camper is in a smoldering pile of ruins. They look at what's left of their lives. As she begins to cough, he hands her the painting she made of their family.\n\nThen, he reaches out and holds her hand.\n\nIn making \"Tumble Dry Low,\" Stein approached the film in two parts. \"First, I thought, what's the most painful thing I can think of that could happen to me and what are my biggest fears?\" he said. \"I came up with a list and chose my mother dying. The trailer became a motif for isolation and we sort of crafted the story around what we had access to.\"\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Close to inseparable, older sister Martina at the precipice between childhood and adult life. But the pair still play and laugh together in their hermetic paradise.\n\nBut their bond is changed when some of their cousins pay them a visit, and as the whispers of a changing family dynamic arise in the background, one sister discovers that the other is changing, almost right before her eyes.\n\nDirector Victoria Rivera -- along with writer Neda Jebelli and producer Camila Zavala -- crafts a soulful, beautiful coming-of-age story about the tiny ruptures that lead to a bigger break in a close-knit relationship. With a luminous, steady sense of craft and a storytelling style attuned to silence and subtlety, this dramatic short crystallizes a small yet significant shift in one young girl's life.\n\nMuch about the film is a pleasure to watch, from the lush, verdant scenery of the film to the relationship between the sisters, which is full of warmth, trust and love. The performances of the two young actresses playing the sisters -- Samantha Medellin and Maria Elvira Ramirez -- are both naturalistic and precise, attuned to the unspoken expectations and expressions that exist between close family members.\n\nThe camerawork is equally as subtle, capturing the story with an almost documentary-style casualness. Yet this seemingly offhand style is actually very specific, attuned to the small ways and gestures of the actors and the little details of their quiet yet shifting world.\n\nSister Emilia is still very much a child, playing with her feet, the cushion on a sofa or with a tree, while Martina is increasingly watchful and self-conscious, observing herself closely in the mirror with narrowed eyes. When Emilia realizes that she is \"left behind\" in childhood by  her bigger sister, the moment is quiet and yet cataclysmic, especially for a character that has no one else equally as close to turn to.\n\n\"Verde\" has a unique storytelling dynamic, in that its coming-of-age narrative focuses less on \"firsts\" and coming together and more on saying goodbye and growing apart. By focusing the story on what is left behind by the inevitability of growing up, viewers are left with an impression of melancholy as indelible yet palpable as the indentation in the cushion left when someone gets up from next to you and walks away.\n\nPoetic, delicate and yet without sentimentality, this is a story about a turning point -- one that happens almost imperceptibly, but has the momentous, quiet undertow of gravity.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But instead of taking a lethal injection, he decides to use his wealth to create a roller coaster so powerful, it causes cerebral hypoxia -- suffocating the brain ensuring a euphoric death.\n\n\"H Positive\" explores the stratospheric heights of a somewhat deluded man -- a man full of insecurity which money hides.\n\nMark has built a world for himself as a cut-throat professional -- a person who relies on his career, but most importantly on the power his career gives him. Secretly, he thinks he'll live forever, so when he is diagnosed with the fatal disease, he's completely devastated.\n\nIf you had a prolonged terminal illness and money was no object, would you manipulate euthanasia so that you could die on your own terms?\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But there's a difference between dedication and obsession... and Will is obsessed to the point of never smiling, never relaxing and never connecting with his fellow teammates. He trains relentlessly, earning the nickname \"The Machine.\"\n\nBut one day while training at a park, Will encounters a new, seemingly casual athlete named Joe, a young man who with seemingly little effort becomes his rival in terms of skill, speed and strength. Confronted with his limitations during a series of increasingly tense contests, Will reveals just how off-kilter he is.\n\nWriter/director Kent Lamm, along with co-writer and lead actor Chris Fornataro, has crafted a sharp, incisive character portrait of a young man dominated by brutal ambition and relentless pursuit of a goal to the exclusion of nearly everything else. Though its central subject is a football player, this is not a story about sports, but about a grasping, almost desperate need that masks itself through punishing drive.\n\nThe visuals and writing take its cues from its main character, whether it's in the kinetic action shots that maintain a constructed, shadowy frame or the taut yet fragmented editing that emphasizes the methodical, pounding rhythm of Will's regimen.\n\nThe few interactions it captures form a portrait of Will's isolation, including the way he pushes himself and how he pushes others away in his quest for achievement. Lead actor Fornataro isn't afraid to be off-putting in his intense, flinty portrayal of Will, but he sets up enough shadings within the mask of hardened aggression he presents to intrigue viewers instead of alienating them.\n\nThe film opens up with the introduction of a new kid in town Joe, played by actor Denzel Whitaker with a compelling mix of affable ease and athletic confidence. In his openness and friendliness, he's almost Will's complete opposite in many ways, and their interaction is both fascinating and tense. When the underlying tension of their encounter rises to the surface as a direct challenge, it nearly unravels Will and offers a fleeting yet undeniably powerful glimpse of what exactly is driving this troubled young man. \n\nThe gift of \"Will 'The Machine'\" is how it handles this small yet powerful moment of revelation, which recasts what we think we know of Will as viewers in a whole new -- and undeniably heart-wrenching -- light. It's handled brilliantly in the acting and directing in both its brevity and its sheer naked terror, as well as in how quickly Will scrambles to hide it after his mask falls. Though it is a small but crucial moment, it has a huge emotional impact, and audiences will be weighing its implications just as this powerful, resonant short comes to an end -- and likely aching with sadness and asking important questions about abuse, masculinity and silence.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Tony needs to decide: should he go about his business or confront the perpetrator?\n\nBut when an egg finally does hit him, he goes after the prankster. And what he discovers upstairs in the apartment above will upend all his expectations.\n\nDirector Sheldon Chau and writer Antonio Garcia Jr. have created a short gem of a thriller, combining narrative surprise, terrific cinematography and propulsive editing to power an audience through an engaging roller-coaster of a film that will take viewers to a place they will not see coming.\n\nThe film has a strong foundation, resting on a tight, well-focused script that develops an everyday city dweller's dilemma into something infinitely darker, and ultimately more devastating.\n\nThe story's element of genuine surprise can't be overstated, but what the film does with that twist is ingenuous, emotionally compelling and demands incredible skill and craftsmanship to carry off. The short pays off that twist in spades, ensuring no moment is wasted or overstays its welcome and making sure each beat lands its visceral punch.\n\nAs the film races towards its climax, what we think has become an ordinary everyday drama has become weighty and even profound -- an example of the surprising ways our sense of ethics and morality are tested in today's world.\n\nThe result is a cinematic experience that begins one way and lands in completely unexpected -- but sadly logical -- territory. \"Flying Eggs\" is ultimately about the tension between what we expect and what really lurks underneath those sometimes paltry assumptions, shaped by our experiences, ideas or moral imagination. With its blend of intelligent writing, intense and economical performances and stellar craft, this is a short that will have hearts both racing and breaking at the same time.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But while the island is undeniably beautiful and idyllic, Sarah is withdrawn, troubled and isolates herself from the rest of the family, especially her uncle Melvin. When Julette tries to pull Sarah out of her shell, she learns her beloved cousin's secret, changing the way she sees her family forever.\n\nWell-written and directed with intentionality and care, the film isn't coy about the nature of Sarah's secret, and is intelligent and sensitive on its portrayal of sexual abuse, and how it forces its victims into silence while protecting its perpetrators. What's unique is that the narrative focuses on a different viewpoint outside the victim-perpetrator nexus. By exploring on how Julette learns about Sarah's secret and its ripple effect within her emotional landscape, it not only creates a mystery that propels Julette forward, but opens up interesting thematic territory that explores how abuse affects the larger ecosystem of the family, and how those dynamics echo then in the larger cultural context.\n\nIt also allows for the relationship between the cousins to come to the fore, creating a beautifully textured and intimate give-and-take between two young women navigating the fraught entrance into adulthood. The relationship is clearly a space for both girls to fully see, hear and witness one another -- not to mention laugh and have fun -- so when Sarah pushes Julette out, it rings as a great loss for Julette.\n\nVisually, the two girls are often situated together in tight close-ups in dark spaces, making for an intensely intimate exploration of character and emotion. These shots are juxtaposed against more distant shots of the male relatives or wide shots of the girls amidst nature, which settles the film's rhythms within Jamaican culture and nature. The mix of tactile intimacy with studied distance evokes British indie filmmakers like Lynne Ramsay or Andrea Arnold, who also employ a composed, artful naturalism to explore women's subjectivity amidst difficult social conditions.\n\nWith its oscillation between the internal and situational, the film rests on the dynamic, natural performances of its young performers, particularly Jordan-Amanda Hall as Julette and Jhada Ann Walker as Sarah. Both actors show a great delicacy and bravery with difficult material, showing great nuance with tough emotional circumstances, as well as treading the line between youthful innocence and wary womanhood. They make the journey believable, sympathetic and resonant for audiences, and when Julette feels compelled to act, viewers know it is out of her deep love for Sarah.\n\nBut when Sarah gently reminds her that it's not her secret to tell, the film also offers a graceful lesson in what it means to support the victims of abuse in our lives. There is much discussion now about \"centering\" stories and what it means to be an ally. But deeply empathetic storytelling like the kind found in \"Cross My Heart\" accomplishes these abstract ideas through artful and meticulous craft, emotionally complex narrative and nuanced performances, using the age-old desire to walk in another's shoes to bring experiences and characters out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

John carries a hammer forged partly from the chains that only recently held him as a slave, and he's determined to earn his living as a free man.\n\nHis feats of strength became legendary, turning him into a potent symbol of endurance and dignity for the labor and civil rights movement.\n\nBut that came later -- first he has to get the job and prove himself first.\n\nThis short allegory is part history, part fantasy -- but above all, it's larger than life and more than lives up to the central character's stature in American folklore.\n\nDirector Brandon McCormick's storytelling is bold and audacious, and the production value lives up to the ambition, boasting marvelous period details, broad sweeping camerawork and strong performances.\n\n\"John Henry and the Railroad\" is a short film of 22 minutes, but it's a grand entertainment -- an unapologetically heartwarming story that inspires spirits and champions the value of \"grit, sweat and love.\"\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

It's not only the last meal for the death row prisoner -- it's also the last one that Maggie will ever prepare since the last meal program is being abolished by the state the next day.\n\nShe goes through an enormous outlay of effort, time and care to prepare the meal. One of her co-workers is skeptical of Maggie's efforts for a man who opened fire in a schoolyard and killed many young children, but the cook justifies it as an act of comfort for a man about to leave the land of the leaving and takes pride in her skill and work ethic.\n\nBut when her kindness doesn't land as intended, the cook reveals perhaps that there's more at work underneath her dignity and generosity than it seems.\n\nWriter-director Courtenay Johnson's powerful, quietly provocative drama functions initially as a character portrait of sorts, portraying the work and effort of a behind-the-scenes worker in what many call the prison industrial complex.  Coming from this seemingly peripheral position, it offers a subtle exploration of loaded yet ambiguous subjects like incarceration, capital punishment, mercy, justice and our own ulterior motives behind our beliefs.\n\nShot with a muted yet rich naturalism and written with a viewpoint that privileges character and environment, the visuals take us through part of a prison's inner workings, and the service workers offer a fascinating perspective on the role they -- and by proxy, prisons in general -- play in the U.S. judicial system, and in the process of justice in general. The storytelling isn't driven necessarily by event and action, but more the inner rhythms and emotional tides of the main character.\n\nActress Dale Dickey essays the role of Maggie, offering a distinctive, multi-layered, and deeply sympathetic portrayal of a complex character. At first, Maggie seems like a down-home, almost folksy character who ekes out dignity and pride to her livelihood. But underneath the persona is a powerful, interlocking knot of inner defenses, true convictions and powerful but marginalized emotional undercurrents.\n\nWhen Maggie discovers the fate of her last meal, and it isn't received in the spirit in which it was intended, it seems to loosen up deep reservoirs of emotion and memory, making for a quiet yet devastating denouement, not just for her work but also for her unresolved feelings.\n\n\"Last Requests\" riffs off the actual demise of the last meal program in Texas in 2011, when a notorious inmate on death row for an infamous hate crime ordered a large, extravagant meal for his last meal and refused to eat it when it was served, saying that he wasn't hungry. Taking this as a jumping-off point, the short offers an indelible, poignant portrait of a woman who finds pride in her work, despite its proximity to a difficult, thorny issue, as well as the unspoken unfinished business of her own life.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

One day, he is outside with his mother one day when a huge fleet of German warplanes flies above him after a bombing raid, which is quickly followed by a group of British Spitfires. The awe-inspiring sight turns into a large aerial battle, and the plane-loving child follows it as one downed plane crashes nearby.\n\nSetting out to find the enemy warplane, David witnessed a pilot escaping the wreckage, immediately running away. David follows, leading to a life-changing encounter.\n\nWriter-director Andrew Muir's short historical drama has a visual sweep and ambition that is reminiscent of the grand old-fashioned studio pictures of Hollywood, with gleaming, beautiful light, sweeping camerawork and an almost epic sense of panorama. What's striking at first glance is how handsome the look and feel of the film is, and while the images are crisp and pristine, the film language itself seems almost nostalgic in its classicism.\n\nBut while the visuals -- accompanied by a rich orchestral score -- possess an almost old-fashioned grandeur, the narrative register focuses on a small, almost poetic encounter between the young protagonist and an enemy soldier, which changes his understanding of war. The film takes its time to set up the time period and place, situating David in history, family and community, but the heart of the film rests on a central conflict between him and the fugitive soldier, who escapes the wreckage.\n\nThis encounter is rendered with little dialogue, as the pair of characters try to understand one another's intentions and capabilities. Tension, curiosity and discovery are deftly built up and revealed in this mostly silent conversation, both in the writing and in the performances. Young actor Patrick McLoughlin captures both David's sense of curiosity and appealing innocence, and his reaction to the soldier has both an openness and a wariness that feels true to character and situation. The soldier is played in turns with a cryptic wariness, a drive to escape and a guarded sense of latent humanity.\n\nThe interaction between David and the German soldier isn't overly sentimentalized -- there is no overdetermined realization of mutual humanity, for instance. But when the pair are finally discovered by the larger community, the emotions quickly escalate, and so does the suspense. And while the German soldier chooses one way, David's fellow villagers choose another path -- one that seems more shocking than the aerial battle he just witnessed. The violence is fleeting, but its intensity is jarring and distressing, for both viewers and David -- and it deeply affects David's understanding of what war really means.\n\n\"Turning Tide\" ends with a subtle -- and perhaps almost too elusive -- set of images, one whose meaning is decoded when compared to the sweeping symbolism of the film's beginnings. Instead of gliding his toy planes in the air in imitation of the ones that have flown majestically above him, David has set them down -- and put away perhaps his reflexive awe at what is essentially the machinery of war, having seen up close what that enmity entails.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But while it adds happiness to their lives, they also see a limit to just how far they can take their relationship.\n\nThis fantastical short romance, directed and co-written by Tom Albanese with lead actor Joey Long, may have demons and monsters, but its conception of fantasy is rooted less in the darkly Gothic or grossly monstrous. Instead, it's closer in tone, feel and execution to something like beloved and legendary TV series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" where the fantasy element doesn't take itself seriously, but instead exists matter-of-factly in a mundane world, offering opportunities for humor, insight and eventually rich emotion.\n\nEven the \"spirit board\" here -- where demon workers answer queries sent over from Ouija boards from our human dimension -- is treated like a boring, dull workaday job, and the fantasy elements emphasize both the relatable human aspect of it while calling humorous attention to the absurdity of modern life. It's a cleverly conceived idea, executed in the excellent writing with a light but sure feel for immersive storytelling pacing, an eye for quirky character detail and a richly imagined world rendered in visuals that meld naturalism with almost tongue-in-cheek fantasy.\n\nIt would be easy for this story to keep piling on quirky world-building details -- and there are many of them, from the bottle of \"Horngaine\" to the demon headbanging to metal. But instead, it chooses to deepen and focus on its main character and the eventual romance he develops with his human Ouija board partner.\n\nWithout any spoken dialogue in the film, the two main characters are forced to communicate only by Ouija board, which is treated as a kind of very slow texting. But the film uses this time and pacing to leverage its excellent performances, which both highlight the humor of the world as well as the genuine feelings of loneliness and eventually connection between the pair of otherworldly lovers.\n\nThe feelings here are understated but very real in their sincerity, and as the couple realizes how much they mean to one another -- and just how they're limited by their circumstances -- the film becomes deep, resonant and eventually heartbreaking.\n\nOften an audience favorite during its successful festival run, \"A Purgatory Story\" is a well-executed (but very hard to achieve) combination of fun, playful and truly moving, and it holds true to its twin imperatives to be entertaining and also emotionally engaging. As a fantasy and a romance, it has a rich, spiritually generous conception of love at its core: it's not just about how two people make one another feel, but how they help one another with the challenges of life and become fuller, more authentic selves. Doing so helps them both move forward, though not without a piercing, even beautiful poignancy and wistfulness that feels very true to our reality.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As Jamie cleans his gun, Scotty leaves.\n\nKingsley tells Scotty about his night. He strikes out with a girl and the guy laughs, saying she turned him down the other night. He talks to Kingsley like they're the same. When he goes to the bathroom, Kingsley pissed in his beer. When he came back, he told him, \"This one's on me.\"\n\nJamie walks in and asks about the plan. Scotty says they're going to wait it out. When Kingsley overhears about the truck, he's interested. Scotty tries to talk Kingsley out of it, but Kingsley is ready. They're going to clean out the truck tonight.\n\nKingsley says Jamie can go and tells Scotty to pack up. Scotty tells Jamie not to come -- he doesn't want him to be like them.\n\nAs they get ready to leave, Kingsley honks for Scotty. Scotty doesn't get out of bed. Jamie walks out and tells him Scotty left and he's supposed to go with them. They take him along.\n\nThey meet up with some friends to discuss the plan. As night approaches, they begin.\n\nKingsley parks in the middle of the road. As the truck approaches, he lights a flare and yells for help. He tells the driver his engine is busted and he steps out to help push with him.\n\nAs the driver reaches for his gun, they jump out and tell him to freeze. Kingsley calls for backup and asks for the key to the back. The driver tricks Scotty into getting into the truck and pulls his gun on him. As they struggle on the ground, Kingsley walks up and shoots the driver.\n\nThey get the key to the back and find crates of animal feed. When they don't find what they're looking for they beat up the driver. Kingsley tells Scotty to kill the driver.\n\nKingsley brings Jamie over and tells him to find something. Jamie tells him there's nothing there and they should leave. Scotty tells Jamie to to to the hill and radio the others.\n\nKingsley and Scotty set the truck in fire. As Jamie runs back, Kingsley is lying dead on the ground. Scotty has a knife in him. Jamie pulls it out and runs from the scene.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

With Olympic trials only two weeks away, he fears he must make a decision: give up or die trying.\n\n\"Blood and Water\" boasts stellar production values, sharp camerawork and a charismatic lead screen presence by bona-fide 2016 Olympic silver medalist Steele Johnson, lending the film a degree of gritty authenticity and impressiveness.\n\nThe story is inspired by director Brian Blum's own experience as a competitive diver. After his head collided with a springboard during a routine dive, he took three years to recover psychologically from the accident.\n\nHis experience lends the storytelling a degree of emotional specificity, transforming the typical comeback story into a riveting portrait of courage and resilience.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Bobby Bell sees him and asks if he wants to play ball. Charlie learns the rules of the game and they start to play.\n\nBobby asks where he's from and what his favorite food is. Then, he makes fun of Charlie's ethnicity and asks if he likes tacos. He then takes the bullying further and tells Charlie to stand still against a wall before getting the kids to pelt him with the ball.\n\nAs Charlie walks home from school, he notices a dead bird on the side of the road. Death is on his mind and he pokes at it with a stick before heading home.\n\nWhen he arrives, his dad asks if he's made new friends. He hides the bullying because he doesn't want to be a burden and goes to his room to read about cancer.\n\nAs months go by, Charlie spends his playground time reading up on the disease. He wants to do something -- anything -- to help his dad win his fight.\n\nBut one day, Bobby runs over and grabs his book. He takes a look and begins to rip out the pages.\n\nHis dad tries to comfort him by saying cancer is like a bunch of uninvited guests. He didn't ask them to come -- they just showed up one day and didn't go home.\n\nDuring basketball, Bobby purposely bumps into Charlie and asks if his dad has died yet. Charlie gets upset and pushes Bobby to the ground. The teacher sees Charlie's action and pulls him aside.\n\nMeanwhile, his dad's condition continues to worsen. He heard what happened in school and tells Charlie that the fight with cancer is his fight -- not Charlie's. But he just runs off.\n\nCharlie sees his mom by his dad's bedside and goes over to lay next to him. Together, they hug him.\n\nThe next day, as Bobby sees Charlie and start to push him. Charlie takes to his dad's advice and ignores it. But then, Bobby slaps him, knocking his glasses off. Fed up, Charlie snaps and pulls Bobby to the ground and starts punching him in the face repeatedly. Charlie takes his dad's fight as his own.\n\nWe find out Charlie's dad had died the day before. And as Charlie narrates the story as a grown-up, he tells us part of him still lies on the bed next to his dad, while another part is on the playground, hoping the fight with Bobby put him back together again.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They ride their bikes to a ditch, then the boy asks to see the hunting knife -- Patrick stole it from his stepfather. He's satisfied and sticks it in the back of his jeans.\n\nThey spend the afternoon wandering their run-down town and take a break at a convenience store. As they walk up, they run into Matt and his sister Susie. Susie begins to yell insults at the boy and he threatens to knock her teeth out. Then, Matt jumps in and grabs the boy, prompting him to pull out the hunting knife. Susie tells her brother they should just go home.\n\nThe boy and Patrick look around the store. When the clerk turns his back, the boy quickly stuffs a drink down his pants. But as he tries to pay for just two chocolate bars, the clerk charges him for the extra drink. He saw them. When the boy insists he didn't steal a drink, Patrick pulls out some money to pay the clerk.\n\nThey sit in the parking lot and eat. Then, the boy tells Patrick to run home. Katya is waiting for him in the car. As she drives, he starts to flirt with her. She complains that he's been missing for three days. He missed the christening and now her mom doesn't like him. He doesn't care.\n\nThey go to an empty lot and the boy and Katya have fun driving donuts in the dirt.\n\nSuddenly, they hear a thud. They get out and realize they accidentally hit a rabbit. As Katya cleans the car off, the boy finds a rabbit on the side. They must have killed its mom -- it's an orphan now. So they decide to take it home.\n\nKatya's dad Leonard is waiting for them at home. Katya tries to show him the rabbit, but he doesn't want anything to do with it. He tells her to leave it but she insists it would die without them. Leonard then focuses on the boy, asking why he wasn't at the christening. The boy lies and tells him he was there. And that he should get his eyes checked.\n\nLeonard drives off and the boy and Katya travel to his house. \n\nThe boy and Katya leave some food for the rabbit and head to the bedroom. As they lay in bed afterwards, the boy tells Katya he has a present for her -- a necklace that belonged to his mom. When she asks if he misses his parents, he says he doesn't know.\n\nThen, the boy tells her he wants to show her something -- but she has to promise not to freak out. He leads her to another bedroom. When he opens it, she sees his uncle's lifeless body lying on the bed. She panics and runs off. The boy chases after her but returns home. He doesn't pick up the phone and just opens and closes the door to his uncle's bedroom.\n\nEventually, he jumps on his bike and rides around town. When he comes home, he sees the authorities take his dead uncle out of the house. As he pleads for them not to touch him, Leonard grabs and hugs him tightly, repeating to him that everything will be okay. It all becomes real for the boy and he breaks down in tears. Without his parents and now his uncle, he has nobody left.\n\nLater that night, as he rides in the back of the car, he just stares at the abandoned rabbit.\n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/rabbitsareforever\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/patchadamsprod\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/patchadamsproductions\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

With a virtual reality headset, Greg can see everything that the fly sees, and he often flies it into his ex's house and spies on her and her current boyfriend -- as well as their most intimate moments.\n\nBut when Greg is discovered and uncovers the nature of Haley's new relationship, he has a chance once again to get close to Haley and extricate her from her boyfriend forever.\n\nDirected by Daniel M. Smith, written by Simon Hewitt and produced by Kyran Speirs and Andrew Ornitharis of Flat Cap Films, this dark psychological thriller takes viewers on a compelling ride as propulsive, unexpected and twisting as the flight path of the drone fly itself.\n\nEvery element of craft is sculpted and hewn with an eye for style and suspense, whether it's in the dynamic camera movements and effects or the excellently structured and paced writing and editing. Like the best thrillers, the storytelling manages the trick of drawing in viewers with tension and keeping them invested in what happens next.\n\nWhile sometimes character building can be sacrificed in the name of plot in most thrillers, excellent performances all around capture the dark, often twisted motives of this cast of dark, lonely souls. Actor Lewis Rainer details Greg as a withdrawn young man fixated on his ex, with equal parts vulnerable, palpable longing and arrogance. He may have remarkable prowess with technology and science, but his social intelligence lags.\n\nAnd as Haley, actor Ophelia Lovibond has an initially difficult task of playing the love object, but has the flinty intelligence and inner strength to make audiences understand why she's so compelling to Greg -- as well as carry off the film's final and most engaging twist, which takes one of the most regressive cliches of the genre and turns it on its head.\n\n\"Flyspy\" isn't afraid to be smart, entertaining, propulsive and what Brits often call \"a nasty bit of fun.\" But it also asks fascinating questions about the growing role of drone, virtual reality and surveillance technology in our lives, using those concerns as a central key element in its plot and how the characters move towards their goals. In doing so, the story also illuminates just how powerful this technology can be, especially when used in service of the darker human impulses.\n\nThe truth is, Greg's use of these already existing technologies isn't such a far stretch into everyday reality. And after viewers have digested the rollercoaster of a plot and enjoyed its wild flight, they may just keep mulling over the real-life implications -- and perhaps never look at a bug in the house in the same way again.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

His best friend offers his girlfriend to practice with, but when Tom begins to have feelings for her, it changes the trio's friendship forever during a party one night.\n\nDirector Alex Murawski's short drama is intimate and even tender, focused on the quiet subterranean feelings that underlie the activity of everyday life.\n\nWith an emotionally acute script and hypnotic, even dreamlike camerawork, the film is alive to the currents of desire and longing that flow between characters, even when they do their best to hide them. The performances are subtle and underplayed, but convey enormous emotion with simple glances and gestures. The situation between the teens could be played for melodrama or crassness, but instead is treated with a sense of both poetry and realism.\n\nAs a result, \"Kiss\" is a sensitive, beautifully drawn entry in the teen drama genre, conveying the emotional turbulence and awakenings of this time of life with patience, intelligence and respect.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She sits at the fast food restaurant all day. Overcome with sadness, she can barely even order a Coke.\n\nWhen FryBaby's employee Craig takes a photo of Emma and posts it online, it quickly goes viral with the hashtag \"dumpedgirl.\" Meanwhile, employee Samantha feels bad for Emma and brings over some fries. Samantha asks if Emma is homeless and if she's okay. Emma says that she's great before bursting in tears.\n\nThroughout the day, Emma just sits next to the window, looking outside at the passing cars and thinking.\n\nA revolving cast of characters appears. First, an evangelist approaches her. Then, two girls take pictures of her after seeing her online. Next, an acquaintance stops by to talk about her breakup. And later, salesman offers to sponsor her. He sells a product called \"Heartbags\" that prevents women from falling in love.\n\nWith each passing day, the crowds grow larger.\n\nFinally, Samantha asks a police officer if he can do something about Emma. He walks over and sits down, asking if she's in trouble and in need of protection. Emma tells him about the breakup. Part of her is waiting for her ex to come back, but more than that, she can't believe it happened. She's numb.\n\nOfficer Williams tells Emma he knows how she feels and they share a moment over fries. Then, he goes back and tells the FryBaby's employees that she's not ready to leave.\n\nThe next day, a little boy asks Emma if she's on drugs. She tells him no and that she's not homeless, either. She briefly explains love and fighting and wanting different things. Before the little boy leaves, he hands her some Mentos and suggests she throw them in a Coke bottle to cheer her up.\n\nEmma decides to change in the bathroom. She approaches Craig and asks him to get his camera ready. Then, she throws the Mentos into a Coke bottle, exploding in front of him. As she leaves, she steps in dog poo on the sidewalk. It's going to be a better day.\n\n\"Fill Your Heart With French Fries\" was inspired by a true story of a Chinese woman who spent a week at a KFC after being dumped by her boyfriend.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Regina wakes up in a sad mood. She mulls around, sitting on her bed and the toilet. Then, there's a buzz at the door -- it's Clara, a professional cuddler.\n\nClara upbeat and chatty. She walks in and compliments the apartment and gets right down to work. She goes over some book choices to read to Regina, then asks what cuddle position she prefers -- the bottom. Regina asks her to turn off the Christmas-light necklace and gets into position.\n\nAs Clara slowly lowers her body atop Regina, she tells her to take deep breaths. Then, she asks for permission to put her head on the shoulder. But when she goes to hug, Regina jumps up in a panic. She's uncomfortable.\n\nClara says she can go slower, but Regina insists it isn't working.\n\nClara tries to give other suggestions, like just chatting, but Regina wants the session over. Clara asks if she did anything to upset her, but Regina stays silent.\n\nWhen Clara suggests moving to the bed, Regina takes it the wrong way and storms out.\n\nShe goes to the other room and sits on the bed. Clara stays outside the doorway and asks again if Regina would like a hug. She tells Clara to charge her for the full session and to leave. And Clara begins to gather her things.\n\nClara then asks Regina to take a questionnaire. Regina is frustrated and raises her voice, telling Clara she'll just sign the bottom and let her fill out the rest.\n\nClara declines and tells her she's proud of what she does and she's a good cuddler and listener. Then, she apologizes to Regina for whatever pain that she's going through. Regina breaks down in tears.\n\nClara slowly walks into the bedroom and sits next to her.\n\nRegina then asks if she can lay down with her for a moment.\n\nAs they lay side-by-side, Clara reaches a hand out. Regina places hers next to Clara's and they hold hands in silence.\n\nIntimacy is scary. In a world where our lives are increasingly public and under scrutiny, basic vulnerability has become an intimidating concept. The film hopes to inspire a generation of people to slow down, breath in, and dare to connect.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As he makes an important call, Jack walks by and begins to make a crude joke about the Queen and sperm whales. As Ed listens, he misspeaks and says, \"I'll be there personally to deliver the sperm.\"\n\nJack cracks up and says Ed will miss him when he's gone -- Jack has been promoted. Danielle tells Ed that he should have received the job, then asks if he's signed Jack's farewell card.\n\nJess hands Ed the card and tells him that he's the last to sign it -- just seal it in the envelope when he's done. Ed decides to get back at Jack and draws a penis in the card.\n\nAs he prepares to leave for the day, Jess asks if Ed wants to sign Jack's farewell card.\n\nEd is confused. Jess says the card he signed earlier was Mr. Morley's sympathy card -- his mom had passed away a few days earlier.\n\nEd pauses in shock. Jess tells him the card he had signed is in Mr. Morley's office. So he sprints to the room at record speed, but he's too late -- he sees the boss opening the envelope.\n\nEd begins to feel nauseous.\n\nMr. Morley takes Ed to his office and asks if he'd drawn the picture. Ed admits that he did. Mr. Morley then says his mom was a nurse in World War 2. She was pregnant with him when his dad was gunned down supplying Allied soldiers. So when he was born, she called him her \"Little Butterfly\" because he was the only thing good that came out of all that mess.\n\nThen, he asks how Ed knew -- they'd released butterflies at the funeral. Mr. Morley opens the card to show that Ed's penis drawing had become a butterfly.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Yet her urge for answers forces her on a collision with the hidden conflicts of her family and marriage... until it doesn't.\n\nDirected by David Rusanow, who adapted the script from a short comic by Chris Gooch, this quietly bracing, keenly observed drama hinges upon those unnerving discoveries that can change the course of a life and confront the self with its unfinished business. Yet while Julie's dilemma is undeniably dramatic, the storytelling also mines a particularly dark, subtle humor, particularly around her awkward attempts to find out just who the used condom belonged to.\n\nThe story could be slanted towards the melodramatic, but the directorial hand at work exercises a discerning restraint on all levels of craft. Much of the film's intelligence is expressed through the beautifully crafted, meticulous visuals. Rusanow not only directed but served as the film's cinematographer, and the brilliantly composed images have a deft, precise sense of telling detail, from the beautiful yet lonely light that suffuses Julie's living room to the strangely radiant gleam of the condom itself, as if piercing through the veil of Julie's carefully composed but empty life.\n\nThe visual acuity is matched by the excellent performances of the cast, particularly by lead actor Dana Miltins as Julie, who is able to portray the disquiet of a woman whose life as she knows it may fall apart, as well as the almost naive hope that, somehow, this will all go away and work itself out nicely. When she finally confronts her husband, we see what wins out in the end -- though Julie's resolution isn't without suspense, as well as its own hidden costs.\n\n\"Mother\" is a domestic drama that achieves its intimacy not through over-explaining or abundant dialogue, but through a poetic, rigorous discernment for the perfect, telling detail, which puts us perfectly in the conflicted mind and soul of its protagonist.\n\nWith an almost forensic level of attention, \"Mother\" becomes a fascinating character portrait of a woman at an internal crossroads in her life: whether or not to find out the truth underneath the pristine surface of her home, or maintain the status quo. Julie's choice isn't a surprising one at the end, but with the film's final lingering image, it's one that will likely haunt her in the future -- and haunt viewers who may recognize the pervasive power of fear and denial at work to maintain their own carefully cultivated surfaces of their own lives.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Instead, he decides to meet with a new person -- a woman named Lily who is said to be a \"good listener.\"\n\nBut when Lily enters Charlie's hotel room, they're both in for a surprise: they know each other already, under Lily's real name. Ten years ago, Charlie abandoned Lily, leaving her broken and alone in life. And now they must reckon with the consequences of those events.\n\nWriter-director Audrey Gagneux's short drama takes the classic two-hander format -- essentially two characters having a conversation together -- and layers a psychosexual element over it. But the drama and action are never titillating or prurient. Instead, it explores the ideas of responsibility to one another and reckoning with the effect our decisions have on one another.\n\nBeing a two-hander, the emphasis falls on writing and performance in the storytelling, especially its dialogue. It's not particularly wordy writing at first, however: instead, it's quite pared down and practices a quiet economy as it parses out key details, relying instead on the intelligence of viewers to piece together the mystery of just what Lily and Charlie mean to one another.\n\nBut as the two characters unravel the messy knot of history between them, the mysteries of their past and their relationship between them unfold for the viewers. The excellent script explores family, obligation and the impact of adult romantic relationships on the children that can get caught in the crossfire told from the point-of-view of those who have to live with the impact of choices they have had no control over.\n\nActors Barry Ward and Tanya Reynolds bring their characters to life with subtlety and honesty, balancing the narrative's need for a slow, gradual reveal with their needs and wants. The result is a slow sleight of hand that works on the level of character, not plot or other story mechanics. The gift of the storytelling is that as viewers unravel what happened between the pair, Lily and Charlie fully acknowledge this as well -- and the acknowledgment opens up emotional terrain for further growth.\n\n\"Lily and Charlie\" ends just before a \"big reveal\" or a cathartic atonement, but while some viewers may crave more, it's still an honest ending, for the arc of the film isn't about repair or reconciliation, but the recognition of the damage that exists between two people. This first step is seemingly small but crucial, allowing for two people to face one another honestly and vulnerably -- and to accept the power and responsibility of their interconnection, however long ago that it happened.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

It takes on the contemporary subject of online and digital relationships, but it asks eternal questions of what it means to really know someone, and whether such an idea is even possible, even in an age of over-sharing and 24/7 communication.\n\nThere is almost a severe sense of realism in the visuals, which manage to be both stark and muted by turns, thanks to an emphasis on natural and practical lighting. True to a film whose main characters are photographers, the cinematography is exquisite and restrained, able to conjure an enigmatic atmosphere by transmuting simple and mundane everyday details into symbols of almost talisman-like suggestion. The framings also alternate between a close, almost intense intimacy and an off-kilter distance when Kim is among Marlon's community, emphasizing her separateness from his community and perhaps her own personal remoteness as a person.\n\nLead actor Kaelen Ohm offers an engaging performance as Kim, whose arc is essentially an outsider coming into an unknown world. The twist, though, is that she believes herself to be more on the inside as one of Marlon's closest confidantes. She speaks with a gentle, kind yet almost naive confidence about his deepest thoughts that she was privy to. And yet as Kim encounters Marlon's widow and their friends, their reactions evince a great skepticism and even hostility towards her.\n\nHow well does she know him, anyway? Could they really be just friends? Was there no ulterior motive? Were they really as close as she believed? Kim finds herself never quite drawn into the fold, leaving her in a state of suspension with her own strange grief.\n\n\"Little Grey Bubbles\" doesn't directly answer those questions, practicing an intelligent, rigorous storytelling economy guided by a sense of restraint and a refusal of easy sentimentality. Instead, perhaps recognizing that those answers are as elusive as an electronic ghost, it lets those questions hang in the air, both for viewers and for Kim.\n\nBeyond that, it ponders just what happens to these modern bonds when they inevitably stop -- as all relationships will, eventually, due either to the vagaries of life or mortality. It has been said that grief is the price we pay for love, and what's remarkable about \"Little Grey Bubbles\" is how it portrays Kim's grief as something essentially separate and isolated from the community of grief that his real-life friends and family share. In many ways, the isolation of her mourning feels a larger tragedy at the end -- and poses disquieting, melancholic questions as many of our real-life relationships shape-shift in life and online as a society.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They want to get his legal case going again and get their father out of prison.\n\nBut the father isn't returning any phone calls from the family. He relates the story of why he is in prison -- an assassination home awry -- and tells his son and his family to forget about him, choosing instead to take his punishment.\n\nBut when his son goes away, the father is taken into a different part of the prison, where the truth of what happened unfurls -- and reveals just how twisted it really is.\n\nWith a sense of the cinematic as wide and vast as its epic vistas and a plot as intricate and complex as the prison itself, this crime drama -- directed by Jhosimar Vasquez and co-written by Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez and Brandon Lee -- uses its considerable craftsmanship to weave a tense, compelling tale about corruption, morality, greed and power.\n\nThe story-within-a-story structure is ambitious, especially for the short format, but the storytelling has a clarity and confidence that patiently lays down its puzzle pieces, starting with the dynamic camerawork and cinematography. The excellent writing and editing are terrifically paced and expertly calibrated, which makes remixing and reassembling the pieces of narrative a highly pleasurable and clever experience for the viewer.\n\nThat narrative reassembling and remixing takes the elements of its central stories and jumbles them into a constantly shifting picture, reinventing images and motifs with ingenuity and cleverness. But this constant shifting is grounded by terrific performances, particularly by Maximiliano Hernandez, who balances both a powerful darkness and flinty, cool intelligence that makes all the story's twists and turns believable and organic to such a complex character. When all the cards are laid out on the table, viewers will likely feel both intrigue and misgivings at its reveal -- but admire the storytelling for its panache.\n\n\"The Scorpion's Tale\" offers a wonderfully woven yarn about the constantly shifting, prismatic nature of \"truth\" and storytelling, as well as the relativity of \"good\" and \"evil\" in such a mercenary world. But beyond those questions, the short is simply a dynamite, fun and supremely confident experience, built on solid cinematic craft and skill.\n\nPolished and dynamic, \"The Scorpion's Tale\" has a verve and brio that begs to be extended into a feature, especially when the titular \"scorpion\" reveals his ultimate endgame, which, in tantalizing fashion, is really a new beginning to what promises to be a fascinating, mesmerizing journey. We as viewers are pretty sure that the destination will be no bed of roses -- but getting there will be a crazy, entertaining ride.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

With his bright future in jeopardy, the confrontation is full of suspense and tension as they do a full search of him and his bag. If he's caught, his life would be destroyed -- jail time and a criminal background would virtually guarantee his scholarship would be revoked.\n\n\"The choice is up to you about whether you think stop-and-frisk is right or wrong. I\u2019m presenting it in a very matter-of-fact way,\" Green said. \"I think the issue needs to be addressed, and that\u2019s why I made a film about it. I hope the film brings attention to this issue in a positive way that asks if there\u2019s a more positive way to go about stopping people.\"\n\nThe ending hints that he realizes the risks and decides that some things aren't worth ruining a life for.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Kate tells him she used to throw away her high school boyfriend's embarrassing clothes. When he'd ask her about it, she would pretend not to know, then help him look for it.\n\nBen asks if Kate threw away his Crocs. She pauses, then swears she didn't.\n\nBen then reveals when he sees an obese person in a wheelchair, he has thoughts of killing himself instead of letting himself get so fat. Kate doesn't think it's that bad. In fact, she admits she harbors those same thoughts, too.\n\nThen, she begins to wonder what other messed up thoughts people carry in their minds.\n\nShe tells Ben she loves the smell of her dirty underwear -- and she picks them up to sniff when nobody's looking. Ben jokingly judges her, and as punishment, Kate makes him tell another secret.\n\nHe does. He says the best sex he had with his ex-girlfriend was a time he fantasized about her sister.\n\nKate continues and tells him she used to lie all the time as a kid. She'd lie for no reason. If a car was blue, she'd say red. Or she'd tell people her name was something different.\n\nBen brushes it off as just being a kid. But then, Kate then begins to break down. She says she needs to tell him everything, which freaks him out a bit. He sits up.\n\nKate says when they first met, she lied about liking the \"The Godfather.\" She also cares that Ben is still friends with his ex-girlfriend. Then, she admits she threw away his Crocs.\n\nBefore Ben can take it all in, Kate says she got an abortion last week. He's in shock, but can't tell if she's serious or lying.\n\nKate then reveals she was sexually assaulted by her foster-brother when she was eight. He said they were playing a game, but when she resisted, he continued. It took her a long time to allow someone to touch her without jumping.\n\nBen tries to calm Kate down. But she begins to panic, telling him not to touch her before storming out. Ben calls her but she doesn't pick up.\n\nThe next morning Kate texts him and they meet up to talk.\n\nFinally, Ben shows a vulnerable side, telling her his secret is that he doesn't have any secrets.

Introverted and unassuming, she works in a drab building, her job is unchallenging and she longs for a sense of connection that seems to elude her.\n\nOne day, however, she gets on a call with David, a customer who proves unexpectedly charming and seductive over the phone. Though there is nothing overtly forward or provocative about the phone call, there is a frisson of desire there -- one that catches fire in Paige's imagination.\n\nConvinced that there is something more to pursue, she decides to break all the rules of her workplace and seek him out. But embarking on the adventure proves perilous, as Paige finds herself out of her depth in the home of a total stranger.\n\nWriter-director and lead actor Louisa Connolly-Burnham's decidedly provocative, pulse-stirring thriller offers a raw, intimate and powerful portrait of a woman pursuing her own desires, in a journey that will pull her through danger and confront her with her own limits.\n\nPropelled by a well-crafted screenplay that expertly parses out tension with each beat, the film possesses the kinetic, sharp sheen of a modern-day thriller, crafted with an eye and ear for intrigue, movement and compelling suspense. Paige's world is rendered in cool, almost wan tones and slick but cold textures, and this version of London is alienating and easy to get lost in. Visually, Paige is often situated in wide shots, lost amidst the urban sea.\n\nBut when she encounters David's voice on the other line, she comes to life as his voice sparks something inside of her: yearning, imagination, and desire. Connolly-Burnham's brave, honest performance details the transformation of Paige as she breaks free of her restrictions and pursues what she wants, in a rich and full character arc that's rare for a short narrative. Paige is tentative, apprehensive and uncertain, but also compelled by a powerful compulsion to do and see more. Watching her negotiate that process -- as well as her eventual encounter with David -- is fascinating, culminating in a climax that will have viewers' hearts pounding and stomachs churning from anxiety.\n\nWell-crafted, consistently compelling and \"The Call Centre\" harkens back to the era of films like \"Fatal Attraction\" or \"9 1/2 Weeks\" -- stories that explored the frontiers of human desire, desperation and violence in a provocative, powerful way.\n\nBut \"The Call Centre\" offers a female empowerment take on the subject, though its particular portrayal of feminine power is complex and intelligent. Paige finds her power, but it is shadowy and unsettling in nature, with its roots in dominance and darkness. In the end, we leave Paige on an ominously clever note, as a changed woman who is mousy no more. What she will pursue and create within her transformation is unclear -- though deliciously troubling to guess at, and worthy of another tale.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But he's struggling to even keep doors open long enough to deliver his message.\n\nBut then, as his training supervisor shepherds him to another house, he gets his first nibble of interest from a man named Marshall... only to spot a Confederate flag on the wall of this potential client.\n\nWriter-director Stephen Takashima's short drama tackles a hot-button topic, unfurling a character-centered story that not only weaves a quiet sense of dread and tension in its storytelling but illuminates the different emotional responses evoked by a controversial symbol.\n\nThe craftsmanship is solid, and the writing is similarly well-structured, building its discomfort with care and precision. As Deshawn gets invited inside a man's house to demonstrate his product, he becomes increasingly tense in the presence of a Confederate flag, leading to a small collision of ideas.\n\nThe writing gives the pro-flag POV an even-handed articulation, portraying Marshall in an understated performance by actor Walt Sloan, who balances notes of wariness and defensiveness with genuine attempts to relate in some way with Deshawn.\n\nBut it also takes considerate care to portraying \"Shawn's\" inner experience, offering a window into the small yet sharp slights he receives from the assumptions that others make due to the color of his skin. Actor Bryson Thomas deftly evokes both Deshawn's discomfort with the racism he faces with his desire to make a sale -- and then, later, to not provoke a conflict. Watching him both suppress his clear discomfort -- and swallow his real feelings -- is difficult and even quietly unnerving as the story goes on.\n\nEven when offered the opportunity to \"discuss\" his opinion, Deshawn recognizes that the \"table\" that he's invited to isn't genuinely balanced, equal or even open to his perspective. In fact, as his interaction with Marshall goes on, it feels potentially dangerous, and the able camerawork and screen direction does admirable work in slowly ratcheting up the tension in a quiet, organic way -- not through the machinations of plot, but through the clash of ideas, emotions and character.\n\n\"Civil\" is a short drama meant to provoke discussions about the historical legacies that America has around race, and it does so through film's ability not just to put viewers in the footsteps of others, but by dramatizing how history and ideology bubble up in our everyday lives and interactions. With its skill in evoking unease and discomfort, it draws audience interest throughout, but the film's main attraction and achievement in the end isn't a thriller-like denouement, but a deeper, more intimate understanding of what it means to be Black in an America still wrestling with its troubled legacies.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They check into a hotel room for the weekend, looking to celebrate a special occasion for Jane.\n\nThey talk, laugh, kiss, goof around, aiming to have fun and \"have a blast.\" They take a bath together; they eat junk food; they play a scavenger game.\n\nAs the evening unfurls, though, there is something just a bit off. Moments that are close and intimate are edged with awkwardness. Jane can't quite relax into the fun. And as the night wears on, it comes clear just why Jane is there and what occasion they are commemorating.\n\nWriter-director Ginger Gonzaga's powerful and moving drama initially seems almost like a documentary of a chapter in the life of a couple and a woman, with a narrative scope that keeps its focus within the hotel room and in the moments unfolding between Jack and Jane. The film is shot with a richly moody naturalism, its camera's keen eye focused on the charming little details that make up happy memories -- the fall of confetti on the floor, the way a hug feels, the pleasure of eating pizza.\n\nThe editing and pacing are dictated by the film's insistence on luxuriating in these sensory details, as well as the strong and playful bond between the couple. At first, viewers may question why the film is taking its time, as charming and whimsical as these details may be. However, as the narrative turns and reveals the true nature of Jane's \"celebration,\" we discover the reason for the narrative sleight-of-hand, and the savoring of moments and details becomes stunningly poignant. Even when the nature of Jane's occasion is revealed, the film insists on taking its time, and viewers get a disconcerting, discomfiting and at times comically mundane sense of a process not often captured or experienced.\n\nActors Ginger Gonzaga and Jason Ritter bring Jane and Jack to life with a great sense of understatement, especially as they oscillate between \"embracing the moment\" and avoiding the reality they're about to face. In many ways, Jane's situation is inherently moving, but the performances have the gift of invoking a rich history and life before the film's narrative begins -- and giving us a sense of what's at stake during and after. It's easy not to be drawn in by the couple and their affection -- which makes the film's reveal all the more devastating.\n\nAt over 30 minutes, \"Your Day\" is especially long for a short film, and these longer shorts are usually tough to program for film festivals. Yet the film enjoyed a robust run on the festival circuit, which is a testament to its ultimate power. Viewers who have the discernment and patience to read between the moments will come away with a profound respect and understanding of life's great passages. The film takes its time -- but in the end, time is the only thing we truly have, to be filled with the small yet beautiful moments and experiences that make up a life.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He doesn't have the last two digits of her number. So he hits the phones, going through every possible combination in order to find the elusive Aimee.\n\nWhat he does when he thinks he finally found her number is funny, very relatable -- and ultimately hopeful to anyone who's ever navigated the often choppy waters of romance.\n\nWarm and witty, \"Digits\" is a brisk, engaging would-be romance that shows how the path to love often takes a few unexpected detours -- and many wrong numbers.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

At one opportune moment, he decides to steal the trophy anyway, bringing his former family unit together in an unexpected way.\n\nWriter-director Dave Edwardz's engaging family drama illuminates the complex, deeply felt emotional world of its young protagonist with empathy and understand. With a clear, gentle eye for poignant moments and a good ear for how people speak and behave, its solid storytelling engages the heart while still reckoning with the thornier side of life, love and loss.\n\nExcellent writing and well-paced editing form a strong foundation to explore young Ben's deep tangle of feelings. Grappling with the splitting of what clearly has been an important family unit for him, Ben longs for a father figure in his life, as well as the feeling of being important.\n\nYoung actor Isaac Natoli offers a natural, subtle performance as Ben, playing both his longing and his anger with great subtlety and yet somehow showing the connection between the two. He plays Ben with both guileless sweetness and pensive world-weariness.\n\nWith such a strong longing, Ben still tries to insinuate himself in the life of Cam, attempting to hold onto the bond he felt with his mother's ex. But when this bond is not fully reciprocated, Ben learns a hard lesson about who his father figure really is -- and who is truly the steady rock of love and affection in his life.\n\nThough the filmmaking isn't flashy, \"The Trophy Thief\" has an unsuspecting emotional richness for a short, with great reservoirs of warmth and feeling for its short duration. Its strength is its unvarnished yet measured sense of how adults can fail children in ways both great and small, and its sensitivity to how these failures of empathy can cause ripple effects in the emotions of kids.\n\nBen must come to his own understanding of who Cam really is, though in doing so, he (and the viewers invested in him) experience a small yet piercing heartbreak. Yet that pain also propels him to greater wisdom, solidifying the most constant source of love and support in his life -- and genuinely earning a heartfelt, poignant ending that leaves viewers with hopeful spirits and warm hearts.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As a result of his long, nine-year tenure, Ex is a superstar at the Bureau of Imaginary Friends.\n\nBut Ex's boss -- a giant teddy bear named BearBear -- thinks it's time for Ex to move on, so Izzy can grow up and make human friends.\n\nEx think he can weather this transition and help 'coach' Izzy into early adolescence. But the transition is bumpier -- and funnier -- than expected.\n\nVisually imaginative and ingenuous, this lovely fantasy is grounded in emotional truth. It charms viewers with a sense of whimsy -- but nearly everyone can relate to the transitions of growing up and leaving childhood behind.\n\n\"So You've Grown Attached\" is a charming delight, imaginative in execution and utterly heartfelt.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Faced with limited prospects, the smart, pragmatic kid decides to help her by sneaking drugs into the U.S.\n\nBut his first smuggle across the \"Devil's Highway,\" a fatal stretch of the Arizona/Mexico border, is not just an introduction to danger, but a rough coming-of-age.\n\nWriter-director Josh Soskin's taut drama is a short that examines the bonds of family, the effects of poverty in the age of globalization and the dangers that emerge when the two intersect. Through precise, fluid direction and a telling eye for detail, the film manages to pack rich storytelling within its economical approach, whether it's the wide shot that shows the sex worker plying her trade in the margins of the frame or the simple way Manny's shoulders drop when he realizes he and his sick mother have no money.\n\nVisually the film is remarkable, capturing the textures and light of the Mexican desert and border town, full of sunfaded colors and the heaps of worn buildings nestled in the hillsides, as well as the lived-in home of Manny and his mother, cluttered with the stockpile of those who hold onto what little they have, no matter what. The images and setting are authentic -- the film was shot in east Tijuana, as well as in the Sonoran desert -- but captured in a subtle, matter-of-fact way.\n\nMuch of the film's power is carried on the weight of its young lead performer, Angel Soto, Jr., who plays Manny with a melancholy and world-weariness, showing what it looks like when children carry a burden of responsibility at much too young of an age. Even as a very young teen, Manny is intelligent, mature and conscientious, which makes it understandable why he would be driven to make such a perilous decision.\n\nBut he is also still a young child, and ultimately in over his head. As the web of drug traffickers and border police weaves itself around him, he finds himself lost -- and the ultimate pawn in the winds of much more complex geopolitical realities much larger than himself.\n\n\"La Carnada\" ends in a twist that is brutal in its calculation, and reveals that no matter how smart, its individual foot soldiers are, there are larger, murkier, ever mutable forces at work that no one player -- or perhaps even policy or law -- can outsmart. But what's brilliant about this powerful film is that it never lets us forget the \"small-scale\" human cost, often made out of ordinary everyday desperation, loyalty and love.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

And when Ingrid is determined to win at any cost, it makes for one very stressful night for Liz.\n\nWriter-director Jan van Gorkum's unique dark comedy possesses both a looseness and precision in capturing the unique familial dynamics of one particular family. Seen through the eyes of a newcomer, the short ably portrays a tapestry of human relationships, as well as the rollercoasters and upheavals they create for the family members.\n\nPrecise, funny and sharply observed writing lay out the minefield of tensions and power plays within the family, and the script is brought to life by a strong ensemble cast that handle both the very real drama while showcasing its absurdity. And when tensions come to a head, the film spins into unexpected directions that nevertheless make sense within the unique emotional dynamic of the family.\n\n\"Game Night\" becomes increasingly tense and even twisted in its way, but the strong direction and craftsmanship navigates the turns with compelling skill and even elegance. With a memorable zinger of an ending, its examination of what it means to be a family should prove memorable, funny and highly ironic.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But he's just a little too soused to take the time to clean up after himself properly.\n\nBut this is no ordinary water closet, and the man finds himself up against a formidable opponent in the battle over proper hygiene.\n\nWriter-director Simeon Duncombe's short comedy is an inventive, ingenious farce, taking full and rambunctious advantage of its compact narrative scale to create a surprisingly action-packed battle between two opponents.\n\nThe film takes place in one space, but with judicial choices of shots -- and truly inventive production and set design -- it creates remarkable visual and narrative dynamism. The clever traps and defenses in the film are both unexpected and yet absolutely logical, and are a mischievous delight to watch unfold. Nimble editing keeps the action humming along at a brisk but clear pace, and each beat ramps up the action, making the audience wonder just what is next for the unfortunate sloppy carouser.\n\nThere are tonal shifts in the lighting and score that may put the film into horror or suspense territory, but they're in service to the film's final punchline -- and establish that when it comes to man vs. environment, the environment will prevail.\n\nThe film's story may be incredibly simple on paper. Many comedies often are, and the real trick is milking the circumstances, character or -- in the case of this film -- setting for all its worth. In this case, the witty use of the setting offers a bravura showcase of the film's real strengths of deep imagination and naughty but good-natured humor. \"Water Closet\" is a funny, fresh twist on the notion of \"toilet humor\" -- and maybe the most brilliant PSA for cleanliness ever made.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He has lost all navigation and communication systems, and he will soon lose his life-support systems.\n\nAlexander soon discovers an Italian radio frequency where a Sicilian radio engineer named Alvaro is working the night shift. The two men form an intense bond as they work through the night and Alexander reckons with the journey that led to the space capsule in the first place.\n\nBut as Alexander drifts away, the newfound friendship between the men may not last the night, and help Alexander find his way home.\n\nWriter-director Andrej Landin takes a meditative, thoughtful tone in his sci-fi short about the mythic \"lost cosmonauts\" that were a supposed casualty of the so-called \"space race\" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to be the first to send a human in space.\n\nThe story has the plot points and development of a thriller, with its elements of space travel and potential disaster. But the beautifully considered craftsmanship and pacing are steady, introspective and measured, with an emphasis on emotional resonance. The images have an elegiac power, full of natural beauty, light and texture, emphasizing just how rich life on earth can be.\n\nAlexander's memories of his training -- and a particular love affair with a fellow trainee named Tanya -- suffuse the film throughout via flashbacks, bathed in the golden hues of warmth and contentment. It can be hard for shorts to integrate flashbacks into the storytelling, but these memories form the sociopolitical context of the story, as well as the emotional core of the film -- and give viewers a palpable sense of loss once we realize just what Alexander is losing as he floats in space.\n\nThrough the understated dialogue and the equally subtle, resonant performances that bring it to life, Alexander's bond with Alvaro forms his final, last attachment -- one that helps him come to terms with his fate, appreciate the richness of the life he has to leave behind and find meaning in the sacrifice that he made before he left earth.\n\n\"Into the Silent Sea\" falls into a rich tradition of sci-fi films that use the vacuum of space and the unthinkable breadth of the cosmos as rich metaphors for the human condition, in all its ultimate helplessness and solitude. It takes its time to tell its story and develop its characters, but the result is a moving, emotionally immersive cinematic experience that tells an unusually full and complete story, with an ending that is bittersweet in its wisdom. As Alexander says, \"We live as we dream... alone.\" But we do carry the richness of memories and love within us, providing some comfort in our final journeys.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

His childhood was troubled and lonely, he burned the family business to the ground and he has never been able to earn the approval of his father. Now an old man, he has had no loved ones or family -- he only has his job knitting tea cozies. On his 70th birthday, having done nothing memorable or in his life, Ernie decides to end it.\n\nHis suicide attempt is unsuccessful, however, and punctures a hole in his ceiling. But he soon develops a bond with a young boy who lives upstairs -- a friendship that pulls Ernie out of his lifelong despair and helps bring hope and connection back into his world.\n\nWritten and directed by Hadley Hillel, this fantasy short has the feel of a modern fable, both in its uniquely stylized look and production design and in the voiceover that opens the film. With richly literary and formal language, the narrator sets up a character and situation that speaks of a stifled life -- a man who, though alive, has not quite lived or loved fully. This isn't Ernie's fault, because his family life has been neglectful and he's suffered much tragedy and bad luck. But it has hobbled his ability to make connections and see the richness of the world around him.\n\nProduction design often plays a highlighted role in fantasy, though the storytelling leverages this tool of craft in a unique way. Rather than aiming for a sumptuous, heightened fantasy realm -- think classic tales like Lord of the Rings but also the highly stylized films of Wes Anderson -- almost the entirety of the film's physical surroundings, including buildings, objects and decorations, are rendered in the humble, ordinary material of cardboard.\n\nErnie's surroundings are not whimsical, inspiring marvel and joy. Instead, their uniform \"brownness\" emphasizes the dryness and monotony of Ernie's world. The only signs of color are in the knitting that Ernie does, both as a way to cope with stress as a kid, as part of his job when he's older, and as a way to help out the boy upstairs.\n\nThe narrative action and the overall expressiveness picks up when the two main characters begin to interact with one another. Though they have no dialogue as characters, the actors deliver their rich performances, particularly lead actor Gary Gorland as Ernie. Played as mild and quiet on the surface, he carries an air of existential despair within him. But he also possesses an innate kindness and sensitivity, which has an opportunity to bloom when he makes friends with his neighbor.\n\nThey're also helped along by a rich and charming score, which adds life and vibrancy to the film's forward movement, especially as the friendship between the man and the young boy grows. They see in one another a mutual solitude and loneliness, and come to one another's rescue at a crucial moment when they need one another most.\n\nThe worldview of \"Ernie\" -- imbued in its voiceover, its approach to emotion and its construction of character -- is fascinating in that it doesn't minimize human suffering. An undertow of melancholy suffuses the film, and both its main characters grapple with profound loneliness emerging from familial neglect and pain. Yet they are able to see one another through: the boy helps remind Ernie of what is worth living for, and Ernie gives the love and acceptance he wanted from his own father to the boy, serving as a father figure.\n\nThe ending of \"Ernie\" is sweet and heartwarming, but it is well-earned, especially in the midst of a world full of pain and dullness. Happiness doesn't come in a vacuum for Ernie: it comes from looking out into the world, seeing himself in another and offering up kindness. In doing so, we not only help others but heal ourselves.\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But as she takes her first call, she finds herself out of her depth with a genuinely distressed man on the verge of suicide.\n\nThe pre-written scripts given to her to deal with callers prove woefully inadequate in comparison to her caller's despair. And in the face of his certainty to end his life, she finds she must throw the playbook out, and truly listen to help.\n\nMoving, funny and gripping all at once, this remarkable drama from writer/co-director Indianna Bell and co-director Josiah Allen takes advantage of the operator's job and situation to go right to the heart of the matter, looking at how we create significance and meaning in our lives -- and how ill-equipped we feel when it comes to alleviating a genuine crisis.\n\nThe narrative structure is essentially a conversation -- one single but pivotal scene in its two characters' lives, whose action happens entirely through dialogue. The production, too, is distilled into a seemingly basic but incisive approach, shot as a single striking take that pushes in from wide to close-up over the course of the film's 16 minutes. Yet the simplicity has a remarkable impact on the storytelling, allowing us to fully experience the ebb and flow of the emotions between the characters, and investing viewers deeply in the process.\n\nWith a pared-down visual approach, the writing stands out as exceptional and is often profound, honest and funny within the same beat. The gulf between the operator's inexperience and her caller's deep-seated depression is often used for humor -- though it's mostly of the \"mordantly witty\" variety. But with its emotional stakes, it also shows the gulf between the well-meaning intentions behind our typical discourse surrounding depression and its ineffectual impact.\n\nActor Caithlin O'Loughlin brings these tensions to life, anchoring the film with a powerful, raw yet precise performance. Her tremendous depths of compassion and warm humor both emerge from a core design to help and do the right thing. Paired with an equally pivotal voice performance by Brendan Rock, her realization that she may just lose her very first caller is devastating -- but it also pushes her to drop all preconceptions of what it means to be there for someone.\n\nMental health awareness has become an important and relevant topic, but what makes \"Call Connect\" especially powerful is its honesty on how helpless we feel when confronted with the raw, ungovernable nature of existential despair. We try to neaten it with tips, scripts and well-meaning lists of things to suggest and try, but these are laughable when someone in the depths of meaninglessness and sees no way out of the pit of darkness they're in.\n\nBut in \"Call Connect,\" what works is an acknowledgment of the difficulty and chaos of such darkly tangled emotions, and how there is no easy, quick solution to isolation or a profound sense of hopelessness. Trying to put a bandage on these trivializes them, and a person in distress or crisis is not fooled by them, either. The idea of fixing such huge emotional issues feels overwhelming to someone already drowning in sadness and agony. But sometimes, in the face of despair, all we can do is try to build a bridge to the next day -- but that tiny step may be more than enough, and perhaps something to build some hope upon.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

In robber mode, she's calm, cool and quietly commanding. But after the adrenaline of crime wears off, she's still left with a dissatisfying and profoundly lonely life.\n\nBut one night after a heist, she sees a clerk from the bank at the bar and starts to make a connection, only to realize that despite her other persona, she's still stuck with herself.\n\nWriter-director Pete Lee's remarkable dramatic short is based on the real-life criminal Peggy Jo Tallas, a fascinatingly soft-spoken Texas woman known by her friends and family for being sweet, friendly and easy to chat with. But Peggy's double life was completely at odds with her daily persona, as she developed her bank-robbing skills, learned to get in and out of banks in under a minute and confounded the FBI, who had no idea at first that they were looking for a woman as their criminal mastermind.\n\nThe story takes this fascinating real-life inspiration and riffs upon it, becoming a compelling character portrait of how people compartmentalize themselves and their feelings, often in the face of daily lives that fail to give them outlets for their creativity, power or any sense of possibility. Lizzy lives with her mother, making for an often contentious dynamic. Her job is menial and unchallenging. Her romantic prospects are nil. There's nothing with a sense of expansiveness in Lizzy's life -- except her criminal \"hobby,\" which exhilarates and thrills her.\n\nThe film's visual style plays with this double-life dichotomy, shooting Lizzy-as-robber in a beautifully smooth, cinematic style with saturated, burnished colors and fluid, graceful movements. But outside of that, the cinematography changes, becomes gritty and almost harsh. The framing changes as well, rarely centering Lizzy in the frame, often visually marginalizing her in her own \"real\" life.\n\nWhat also makes the double act work is the central performance of Missi Pyle as Lizzy, who captures both the quiet, powerful thrill of robbing banks and the dead weight of her daily life in a relatable, authentic way. Without saying as much, viewers can sense Lizzy's sense of wildness and adventure buried underneath the dinginess of ordinary life, as well as the profound melancholy of being locked in an existence that doesn't allow for any sense of freedom or liberation.\n\nWhen Lizzy finally makes a genuine human connection, we sense the effort it takes to hide her neediness and desire. But her vulnerability seeps out anyway, helping viewers root for her and making for an ultimately heartbreaking encounter.\n\nWith its fascinating with the outlaw ethos and its attention to the details of ordinary existence, \"Don't Be a Hero\" has a sense of stylishness and insouciant self-assurance that's reminiscent of the great Hollywood cinema of the 70s, which often sought to explore the quiet anarchy, intensity and wildness of post-hippie America, as people sought to throw off lives of \"quiet desperation.\"\n\nLizzy's way of fighting against the tide may be unconventional -- and against the law -- but by film's end, it becomes understandable, especially in a world with so little room for authentic freedom. We all have a strong drive to find a place in life where we feel free enough to bring our fullest selves -- a drive compelling enough to seek any way to express itself, no matter what.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Pensive and melancholy, she also thinks about death. She isn't necessarily at the edge of crisis, but she questions her very existence and the seeming meaninglessness of life.\n\nBut then a co-worker, Robert, takes a romantic interest in Fran. As their gentle flirtation develops, it opens spaces within Fran that may draw her out of her isolation -- but it also could let in a pain that she's long-held at bay.\n\nThis Oscars-shortlisted, Sundance-selected drama short -- directed by Stefanie Abel Horowitz, who also co-wrote the script with lead actor Katy Wright-Mead and playwright Kevin Armento -- achieves a gentle yet masterful command of tone and craft, offering a deeply affecting character portrait of a woman mired in social isolation and depression.\n\nDepression, with its atavistic malaise and sense of being \"stuck,\" can be difficult to dramatize, but the film wraps its slender yet finely wrought narrative with a portrayal of Fran's larger psychological landscape that shows the interplay between Fran's thoughts and the ripples they make on the surface of her life.\n\nThe visual approach of the short reflects Fran herself, with beautifully composed shots rendered in muted, dusty cinematography that often move with a sense of tentative drift. The sound is also remarkably quiet, emphasizing silence and pauses and adding to the isolation and aridity of Fran's world.\n\nA beautifully written voiceover woven throughout the narrative is key to the film, offering intimate access to the texture of Fran's thoughts as she goes through the motions of work and life. Her thoughts can be richly whimsical and idiosyncratic, revealing a dry, quick wit -- but they also question the very purpose of life itself and disparages Fran's very existence, with a weighty sense of futility that is debilitating and paralyzing.\n\nWhen Robert enters the story, it gives both the story and Fran a sense of forward momentum, as well as a sweetly tentative charm. Yet the opportunity for intimacy and connection also threatens to unravel the edifice that Fran has erected around herself, and actor and co-writer Wright-Mead's performance delineates the slow destabilization in such a self-contained character with great empathy and precision. The painstaking care in building Fran's character and world pays off, however, in a quietly cathartic conclusion that is both heartbreaking in its sadness yet hopeful in its vulnerability.\n\n\"Sometimes, I Think About Dying\" is unique in films about mental illness in that it doesn't pathologize the condition. It's not presented as a crisis to get through or a condition to overcome, but something deeply ingrained within Fran's very being. There is no tidy conclusion, and the arc of the narrative isn't one of triumphing over the odds. Resolutely unsentimental, it is clear-eyed about how insidious depression is.\n\nMany sufferers of this incredibly common condition will appreciate this, knowing that the hard work of dealing with depression is never such a linear process, but an ebb and flow between isolating numbness and deeply held release. This is a film that honors the reality of how complex and intricately embedded depression can be -- but also honors the tiny yet momentous steps it takes to reach out.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She has finally lodged a complaint against him and now is due to hear the results of her company's investigation.\n\nBut the face-to-face meeting quickly veers from a degree of civility to one where Emma finds her original testimony and evidence distorted, picked apart or prevaricated by the company's representative. Emma's case hangs in the balance -- but more importantly, so does her sense of security.\n\nThis compact yet powerful dramatic short -- written and directed by Hazel McKibbin and produced by Stephanie Fine -- has very relevant themes of sexual harassment at its center, but it is also essentially a conversation. As the action unfolds, viewers quickly realize that the conversation is not a mutual back-and-forth, but a lopsided dynamic skewed in favor of a company trying to protect itself versus a young worker trying to be heard and validated.\n\nWith a title about language and a structure of a two-hander, the storytelling leans heavily on excellent writing, which was heavily based on McKibbin's own experiences with reporting sexual harassment. Language and communication are what Emma presents as evidence of her harassment; language is also one of the ways that she has been harassed. And sadly, the sharp, incisive dialogue shows how language can take a truth and twist, obscure and wrap it in ambiguities, to the point of meaninglessness and distress.\n\nThe language of the writing is deft, agile and slippery in how it inflicts its own violence upon Emma, but the visual approach is clear, deliberate and powerfully lucid, with coolly clear tones and a sense of composition that is almost abstract in its attention to the small but telling detail. Every camera movement emphasizes the shifting of power in the room, and the editing captures the small gestures and unspoken behavior that reveals the real agendas at work in the meeting.\n\nLead actor Angela Wong Carbone's understated yet wrenching performance does the important job of bringing viewers into the subtext of the film, playing out her unspoken pain and disappointment as her trauma is essentially invalidated, and she's rendered powerless and unimportant, both by the process and by key betrayals during her meeting. Like the rest of the film, there are no melodramatics, but instead, the wrenching portrayal of someone having to swallow their voice, again and again and again.\n\n\"Doublespeak\" offers an intimate snapshot into one woman's experience of reporting harassment, but it is also as much about process and systems as about Emma's individual story. Emma is caught in a system and dynamic in which she is just a small part, and it is this system that sets up the rules, as well as the checks and balances on them when they're broken. Sadly, it is a system more concerned with protecting itself, discrediting those that question it, and offering empty promises and apologies. Its masterful last scene is both a marvel of restraint and a chilling evocation of the price paid for this -- which is almost always paid by those already at a disadvantage in the system.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She has spent her adult life taking care of her husband and son. But now that she's not needed by them, she discovers that she's not respected, taken for granted by those she cared for most.\n\nIt's time for a change, she decides, so she hits the road with her suitcases, eager to restart her life. But on her way out of town, she hits a car belonging to Jelly, the town junkie. But this was no ordinary accident, and Maureen must work with Jelly to hide what happened before she can truly be free.\n\nWriter-director Alexandre Dostie's short is about an older woman finding her way back to her path in life. But this is no aspirational \"Eat, Pray, Love\" type of story, and it also isn't the meditative naturalistic drama one could expect from such a logline, though it has a muted, almost grim palette of cool tones and muddied colors that often characterizes such narratives.\n\nInstead, it's a wild rollercoaster, achieving a high-wire balancing act of suspense, thrills and rich character work. At 23 minutes, it's a longer short than most, but that run-time packs a remarkable amount of narrative. The excellent script never feels overstuffed, however, keeping Maureen firmly in its crosshairs from moment to moment. The pacing is also key, slowing down at key moments to observe the subterranean realizations and decisions that Maureen makes, which makes the impact of her actions later all the more powerful.\n\nThe craft is impeccable throughout, but the key element of the film's success is the character of Maureen, who is written and performed with a deep well of empathy and authenticity. Actor Martine Francke's performance captures Maureen's many layers, from her sensitivity to her deep, almost gnawing hunger for autonomy. She embodies how Maureen has become worn and burdened by her roles, and also her fear that she has disappeared as the central character in her own life.\n\nWatching Francke negotiate the push-pull between an almost ingrained instinct to care and nurture and an increasingly strong desperation to be free is fascinating, especially when it becomes clear that the auto accident has become yet another mess that she needs to clean up and manage. So it's no surprise that she decides to make a truly desperate choice -- one that spins the story into a tense, chilling climax and conclusion that both shocks and haunts.\n\nHaving enjoyed a remarkably successful run at festivals like Toronto, Clermont-Ferrand, Palm Springs and Sundance, \"I'll End Up In Jail\" is a cinematic grand-slam home run: an engrossing narrative that can veer from drama to thriller, with plenty of humor thrown in; impeccable visuals that highlight both the tautness of suspense and the desolate world that Maureen lives in; and a richly drawn central character that compels, even when she enters morally ambiguous territory.\n\nFor Maureen -- and perhaps for many caretakers -- roles and relationships often change from refuges of love into straitjackets of sacrifice, where others feel entitled to labor and energy without offering appreciation or affection. Achieving emancipation often means confronting hard truths and breaking down the limiting structures that limit us. Maureen's own journey to liberation in \"I'll End Up In Jail\" is bloodier than most. But in its wildness and violence, it's perhaps a heightened version of the fight it sometimes takes to break free and make our lives our own.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

James Dean filmed his last film in Marfa; it's also one of the most buzzed-about hubs of contemporary art in the U.S. As a place, it seems to combine a sense of a borderless, amorphous past immune to history with a feeling that anything unexpected can show up.\n\nFilmmaker Greg McLeod first traveled to Marfa from his native England for the town's film festival many years ago. When he returned, he collaborated with his brother and filmmaker partner Myles on a uniquely hypnotic and visually arresting animated travelogue, full of small vivid moments, stories that capture the sense of an eternal Americana and characters that seem to exist in their own netherworld.\n\nCombining photos, audio footage, interviews and beautifully rendered ink-and-watercolor hand-drawn animation, the film captures Marfa's impressionistic yet vivid sense of place. As a result of its craft and technique -- and enriched with a rich sound design by Tom Angell -- this short animation about a captivating place is in itself remarkably entrancing, and accomplishes the feat of turning a place into a character, with its own sense of logic and time.\n\n\"Marfa\" went on to have its debut at Sundance and played at over 20 other prestigious festivals, where it was lauded for its loose, lively feel and its stellar sense of craftsmanship. Many of us may never get to see Marfa, but through this remarkable travel documentary, we can enjoy seeing it through a singular, brilliant vision.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But even when she makes it into the U.S., she encounters obstacles and pain of a different nature, and one not easily solved by a journey or a reunion.\n\nWriter/director Elaine Wong's short drama has many layers: it's a poetic yet gritty exploration about immigration, a love story about a wife yearning to reunite with her husband and a poignant but painful coming-of-age tale about reconciling the gaps between expectations and reality.\n\nThe film's subject matter offers a unique take on the loaded subject of immigration, turning a lens on Chinese migrants, who pay large sums of money to human traffickers (called snakeheads) to come to the U.S. through Mexico, a journey that can take several months.\n\nThe visuals take a poetic, subjective approach, creating a dreamscape of memory and sensation as Ah Wei proceeds along her journey. The first part of the film mixes dark, textured images of the journey with dreamy sunlit footage of California and audio of her sweet, intimate conversations with her faraway husband, the audience enters into Ah Wei's headspace, and understands her deep yearning for her partner.\n\nThis textural, almost experimental approach keeps the focus on the deeper, more inner-directed reasons on why Ah Wei would subject herself to such danger by choosing a fraught, perilous route to join her husband, even when the nature of the journey offers moments of almost thriller-like tension and suspense. These moments are well-crafted and inject a different energy into the story, but the story doesn't end when the journey end. In fact, as Ah Wei discovers when she is reunited with her husband, it is a whole new challenge, sending the film into a quieter, unexpected direction.\n\nThis final part of \"Where Dreams Rest,\" however, is really where it distinguishes itself from a typical immigration story. In focusing on the reunion of Ah Wei with her husband, the storytelling slows down to the present tense, where every pause, glance and look away registers a heavy weight. Ah Wei discovers that her most cherished dream is simply not the reality, and the gap between what she hoped for and what exists in front of her is devastating. This shift is registered with such subtle clarity and delicacy that its final sensations and feelings continue to haunt after the film's conclusion, like an uneasy memory or a lingering doubt.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But their first moments reveal a dead electrician -- an ominous omen if there ever was one.\n\nDespite the dead corpse, the new ad-hoc family unit moves in. But as they adjust to living together -- and occasionally chafe at their new domestic intimacy with one another -- the house reveals its own agenda as it slowly turns each member of the household against one another.\n\nWriter-director Jason Gudasz's offbeat short injects elements of psychological horror into what is essentially an awkward, off-kilter dark comedy about home, belonging and family. Jagged in pacing and editing, it deconstructs the look of an indie family dramedy, as it zigzags between characters and genres, engaging viewers with an accomplished sense of craft and a wry, unique eye for how people can be lonely and isolated, even when they're sharing the same room.\n\nThe storytelling is more layered and ambitious than most short films, juggling three separate storylines as each character develops a unique relationship to the house. As the house's paranormal tendencies ramp up -- and are excellently constructed through sound and image, instead of special effects -- the trio grow apart from one another. Instead, each character becomes more enmeshed with the house, often to strange and insular effect (which goes hilariously unregistered by the other characters.) \n\nVisually, the film also echoes this trajectory, deconstructing the look and feel of an indie family dramedy. As the narrative proceeds, the palette darkens and the editing seems to disintegrate into shards, as the story and the characters descend into an almost schizoid mode of behavior. \n\nLauren and her new family unit become increasingly outlandish and surreal, but it's sold with an excellent ensemble cast who balances the complex performance demands of the story. Each actor has to match the studied, awkward, almost mannerist tone of the storytelling, but they also have to come from a genuine emotional place. \n\nThey must register the growing detachment, isolation and even resentment of one another, while still hitting the \"WTF\" oddness of the film's humor. But when it all comes together -- and the family settles into the configuration that the house, and Lauren, truly desires -- it results in a truly engaging, unexpected experience: one with a genuine freshness in voice, tone and sensibility that entertains but also challenges the audience with original storytelling.\n\n\"Place\" premiered at Sundance but also made waves at prestigious horror festivals like Fantasia and Fantastic Fest, which demonstrates both the success of its cross-genre pollination and its singularity of voice and vision. Absurdist and sharp, it gently interrogates the notion of the traditional family configuration, and may even have intriguing readings during a time when many of us are home more than ever -- and perhaps confronting the hidden and subsumed dynamics underlying our own lives.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

And in revenge, she makes Lynn smell a series of increasingly disgusting scents.\n\nAfter Lynn moves to a new place out of town, Jenny finds herself blossoming, as she tries on new identities -- dancer, food blogger, archaeologist -- with increasing confidence. But when Lynn reinserts herself back into Jenny's life in a legitimately bonkers development, Jenny must find the inner strength to assert herself against a stronger, more dominant best friend-slash-biggest frenemy.\n\nHigh-spirited, risk-taking in its aesthetic exuberance and with an anarchic energy that mirrors the highs and lows of teenage experience, Christopher Good's \"Crude Oil\" is a fresh, rollicking take on adolescence, female friendships and identity that pulls viewers into a fun, wild yet ultimately poignant vortex of buoyant creative vision.\n\nThe film is only 14 minutes, but it packs an immense amount of roller-coaster narrative and expressionistic bravura within its runtime, which is both its genius and its challenge. The pacing is quicksilver and frenetic, careening between montages, special effects and flashbacks with a rhythm that wouldn't be out of place in a dubstep song, and it may take a while for viewers with more traditional expectations to settle into the film's unique rhythms.\n\nThe style is colorful, joyous but not slick: there's a warm, even goofy aspect to the visuals that doesn't take itself seriously, though it does revel in the pure possibility of cinematic craftsmanship. The storytelling combines both a traditional coming-of-age friendship story with a winking, wittily ironic riff on superhero stories, but genre here is merely another ingredient to add to a very ebullient cinematic cocktail.\n\nUnderneath the cinematic joyride, there's an emotionally complex and archetypal story about finding one's voice in a toxic relationship. Jenny's history with Lynn (and her boyfriend Ken) is handled with aplomb, as is her thriving when Lynn is far away, and the film's hyperactive zest neatly mirrors Jenny's own bubbling enthusiasm as she starts to find her purpose and passion. But when Lynn comes back into Jenny's orbit to reassert her control -- in a way that's both hilariously literal and metaphorical -- Jenny must use her own inner resources in an unusual yet ultimately relatable showdown.\n\nFeatured at Sundance and a highlight of its touring shorts program, \"Crude Oil\" takes many risks in its style but achieves vivacious originality -- you simply don't see a lot of short films that feel this way and pull it off with panache and insouciant assurance. But its themes and emotional resonance are very recognizable, framed as a superhero-ish fable about breaking free from a codependent relationship.\n\nJenny literally must free her internal dialogue of Lynn's presence, and she does it with the same tools available to anyone who's ever had to deal with a bully, dump a toxic partner or stand up to an oppressor: she has to speak up and draw boundaries. Jenny may have a seemingly silly, useless superpower (though one never knows when the power to make someone smell cat feces could come in handy.) But the one she ultimately draws upon is refreshingly yet still remarkably human: her own voice.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Bandaged but still badly injured, the disaster's sole survivor makes his way through the desolate polar wilderness, trying to find some kind of help or human contact.\n\nHe makes his way to a convoy of freight vessels, hoping to find some human presence. But the ships are burning, dashing his hopes for rescue. At his lowest point, however, he experiences a mystical moment of transporting beauty that blurs the line between fantasy and reality.\n\nWriter-director Dylan Pharazyn's visionary sci-fi short is ruthlessly elegant in almost every aspect, with no dialogue and only the most stripped-down narrative to develop and follow. There is only one character, and he has one aim: to get help and stay alive.\n\nBut in terms of visuals, the short is richly conceived and often astonishing, capturing both the epic, raw and desolate icy wasteland of Antarctica and the paranormal apocalyptic inner fantasia of the main character as he is on the verge of despair and annihilation.\n\nThe film's stream of images -- as well as the excellent, disquieting ambient score -- communicates and conveys the extremity of both the environment and the survivor's life-or-death situation. The antagonist here is the unforgiving polar landscape, and it is rendered here with brutal majesty, with images that capitalize on film's primal power to transport viewers to a place almost beyond most people's imaginings.\n\nThe film's main thrust, however, occurs as the disaster survivor experiences a vision of strange, mesmerizing crystalline beauty as he realizes the dire nature of his situation. Beautiful and hypnotic, it's as if the snow and ice of Antarctica enlarged itself to dominant proportions and taken over the man's consciousness to an almost phantasmagoric level. This reverie pushes the boundaries of visual imagination, creating an oddly captivating idyll of pure visual music for both the man and the viewer.\n\nWhether it's another dimension opening up or the last visions of a man between the realms of life and death is up to interpretation. But no matter what the conclusion, it lingers well past the ending of the film. Though it's only eight minutes, the short has the impact of a much longer film, thanks to the densely imagined world it evokes and the power of its visual bravura.\n\nFilmed on Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand, \"Vostok Station\" was a rare sci-fi selection for Sundance Film Festival, and also a significant technical accomplishment, with its combination of stunning photography and virtuosic post-production work. On a creative level, the short pushes the short film format and is almost experimental in its painterly approach to visual effects.\n\nBut it is also that most classical of stories: man vs. nature. But \"Vostok Station\" leverages the unique power of cinematic craftsmanship to evoke a view of nature at its most extreme and inhospitable to human presence. Then, placing its sole character within this apocalyptic post-human vista, it then offers a vision at the extremes of human imagination and feeling, one that is intriguing and haunting in its almost spiritual power.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

It's \"racial glaucoma,\" which prevents them from seeing the efforts and contributions of people of color.\n\nBut there is hope: there's a special treatment available that can help. It's called \"Lazercism,\" and it might just save the world in a quick, easy way.\n\nDirector Shaka King offers a sharp, satirical comedic take on racism and perception, taking the form of daytime TV staples like talk shows and infomercials to offer a fresh, funny but incisive take on an incendiary issue.\n\nThe short, which made a splash at this year's Sundance, pulls no punches and doesn't shy away from its subject matter or its politics. With a terrific lead performance by Lakeith Stanfield -- who has starred in projects like Atlanta, Get Out and Sorry to Bother You -- It's bold and in-your-face, taking the sometimes garish look and exaggerated emotional register of television to examine the often subtle issues of worldview and perception.\n\n\"Racial glaucoma\" is an inventive, funny and pointed term that leans on the overmedicalized parlance of a world where every problem has a prescription. If entrenched racism and unexamined privilege is an affliction, then why not have a treatment for it? The film's proposed solution is obviously satire, but the ailment is undeniably real.\n\nThis premise informs the whole of \"Lazercism,\" and while it hits notes both hilarious and dark, stretching the premise to its fullest conclusion takes the film to a place of genuine emotion and pain, and offers a plea for empathy and understanding that, in the end, is so obvious -- but seemingly so difficult in a world where people may not even see the problem in front of them. \"Lazercism\" uses humor and imagination to tell people to open their eyes and see the full humanity of everyone around them.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Her own husband seems distracted by his strange obsession with capturing a snake, widening a gulf between the couple, even as they hope to start a family soon.\n\nBut when her husband's captured snake breaks out, it disappears into their shared home, seeming to escalate the wife's gastric distress. Feeling increasingly invisible in the world, she seeks out relief, but as her attempts continue to fail, she struggles to find an answer to what ails her.\n\nWriter-director-animator Song E. Kim's Sundance-featured short animation uses the detailing possible with its style of line-heavy drawing to capture an alienated, isolating world that characters drift in and out of, wrapped up in their own concerns. Its slightly distorted way of portraying human characters also captures how the wife turns and twists in upon herself as she grows more and more apart from the people in her life, which includes an intrusive sister and a doctor who seems to barely notice his patient at all.\n\nThe storytelling exists solidly within a subgenre of domestic dramas examining marital or familial discontent -- of people who are supposed to be connected and yet are not, and whose disconnection makes them feel lonelier than ever. Both the main characters of the story are searching for something elusive, whether it's truth, meaning or connection, and can't seem to walk alongside one another in their quests.\n\nInstead, they are both alone in their existential journeys, lost in a world that seems both empty and overwhelming. This world is constructed not just in the animation style, but also with a rich, almost dense sound design. Though there's little dialogue, the sound of the world is full, even bustling, which offers a contrast between the spare, minimal lines of the visual style. The discordant, ominous musical score also adds to the film's emotional register and escalates as the wife comes to realize just how far her husband is from her psychologically.\n\nThe couple is connected, though, by the evocative symbolism allowed for by animation, particularly in the form of the snake, which here often appears foreboding and unpredictable as it appears throughout the film. As the wife becomes even lonelier and more wracked with pain, the film takes a turn towards the surreal -- and the snake and the wife become intertwined as she faces the depth of her aloneness in the world and her marriage.\n\n\"Bite of the Tail\" is modern in look, ancient in its symbolism and relatable in its evocation of how we feel alone, even when we are surrounded by the people we love. Serpents are symbols of wisdom, healing and transformation, and of course, a snake biting its own tail is an ouroboros, which represents eternity and continual renewal of life. The complex unraveling of this symbol at the film's end and the emotional low point actually may offer a flicker of hope for the husband and wife -- although how it may play out remains ambiguous, as are most of life's difficult realizations and transitions.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

An outstanding singer, with a promising future, she dreams of studying in America. But her dream will be at the cost of her father\u2019s life if she doesn\u2019t return.\n\nDirector Minji Kang's short chamber drama is at heart a story of familial and intergenerational conflict, but set in a unique crucible: the authoritarian politics of North Korea, whose pressures distort and warp the father-daughter dynamic to an untenable, shocking point.\n\nGuided by a well-paced script and taut, elegant camerawork that captures the daughter's rarified surroundings, the film is fueled by excellent performances that capture many of the unspoken agreements and expectations that exist between family -- as well as the explosive pressures that eventually erupt between a father and daughter who want diametrically opposed goals.\n\n\"The Loyalist\" delineates both characters of the father and daughter with compassion, capturing the complex knot of family, honor, love, loyalty and duty that bounds the pair -- and making the film's climactic moments all the more devastating. The heartbreaking, shocking ending moments of the film will linger, long after its conclusion.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

With loose, agile camerawork, the film has the feel of a documentary, capturing the textures of village life as well as the emotional fears that face the brother and sister as they grapple with the aftereffects of the disease that has ravaged their home and everything they know. With no one left in their family to rely on, they don't know who to trust, and are quickly swept up into a quarantine situation that frightens them even more.\n\nFast-paced editing keeps the audience on their toes, reflecting the discombobulation felt by the children at the center of the story. They are uprooted and frightened, finding themselves in the middle of an international maelstrom with no anchor to keep them steady or foundation for them to lean upon.\n\nThe film rests on the performances of its child actors, which are superb and honest. The result is a film that is a gripping and intimate look into the ravages of an epidemic that garners plenty of headlines -- outbreaks are still ravaging eastern Congo -- but rarely is given an emotional face by the news stories. \"Out of the Village\" asks: if it takes a village to raise a child, what happens when the village disappears? The answer it teases is both heartbreaking and hopeful, offered in a film that is deeply human and compassionate.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He greets a neighbor and walks into the house. His wife is making dinner. He gives her a quick peck on the cheek and goes to the living room to watch TV.\n\nThey eat without saying a word. Later, in bed, they read in silence.\n\nThe next morning, he hops on his bike and goes to work. But his usual route is blocked. He takes a detour through the red light district and notices a prostitute in the window. She waves at him, but he keeps going to work.\n\nOn the way home, he passes the prostitute and they wave to each other. He arrives home and gives his wife a kiss on the cheek and goes to the living room.\n\nAs they eat in silence, he thinks about the prostitute.\n\nThe next day, he stops at the window. She opens the red curtain and gestures for him to come in. He replies that he's late for work and rides off.\n\nHe browses the Internet for red curtains.\n\nThat night, he lies in bed, smiling at an idea. Then, gives his wife a kiss and goes to sleep.\n\nThe next day, a delivery man arrives with a package -- red curtains. His wife finds it odd, but lets him put them up in the house. One the way to work, he waves to the prostitute.\n\nThen, he begins to look up furniture pieces in the same shade of red -- chairs, rugs, lamps. He bikes home with the bags of red items and sets them up the room. He asks his wife to sit as he goes outside to look at her through the window.\n\nThen, he shops for lingerie online. He rushes home to knock on the window. His wife opens the curtains and he gives her a present. Later that night, the excitement returns to their love life.\n\nThe next morning, he waves at the prostitute on his way to work. He's a bit more energetic at work. He goes home and knocks on the window. The curtains open to reveal his wife in lingerie. He sees the neighbors watching and gives them a smile and walks in.\n\nThey kiss passionately. She goes through his wallet and takes his money. Then, they head to the bedroom.\n\nThe next morning, he's extra early and excited for work.\n\nHe returns home and knocks on the window, but his wife doesn't answer. The door opens and another man walks out. She asks him for the money, but he doesn't have enough. He goes to the ATM. At work, he sits thinking. Then, he bikes home to see a line of men in front of his house.\n\nHe angrily rips down the red curtains.\n\nThey sit eating in silence as before. Then, he bikes his usual route to work.

The home's decor, weather and seasons all change as the family circles through several events and emotions that test their connection.\n\nVan der Woerd used complex camera rigs to meld together different shots into a seamless, elegantly fluid whole -- all while dealing with a large cast of actors portraying the family over time.\n\nThe director's craftsmanship and acumen are all readily apparent, used in service to a larger, emotionally resonant story. By keeping the space of the film unified while compressing the years the family journeys through together, \"Growth\" ably captures how time can both salvage and ravage relationships, revealing how emotions can imperceptibly build and warp under the surface until they're impossible to ignore.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But as they continue to play, Raul coughs and coughs, clearly dying. Despite his illness, he soldiers on, doing his best to conceal his dire condition from his daughter as they continue on their mission -- until the truth of his situation is revealed.\n\nWriter-director Gabriel Savodivker's short sci-fi family drama has a loving, fanciful premise, focusing on a warm, affectionate relationship between a father and his child. Willing to enter into her imaginative world, he at first seems like an indulgent parent, following her leads into a flight of fancy.\n\nBut as the story progresses, it becomes clear that all is not well with Raul, and the glimmer of tragedy darkens the storytelling. Though he does his best to keep his daughter protected from his dying, the audience is privy to this fact, making his efforts all the more touching and even heroic.\n\nPerceptive writing and strong acting from young performer Nayeli Alarcon and actor Paulo Quevedo establish a strong, loving bond between parent and child, with a clear warmth and affection. Quevedo especially plays the difficult tension of a parent struggling to keep his daughter feeling safe, happy and loved while knowing he will have to say goodbye to her soon.\n\nThe film's visual style remains firmly with the parent-child pair for most of the film, keeping within the enclosed space filled with lights and playthings. For the most part, the action is shot as close-ups, which gives us an intimacy with this small family, though camera pans, brisk editing and angle changes keep the short visually dynamic. The sound, too, establishes the imaginative world of Sol and her father, using camera and sound effects to create their own charmingly lo-fi version of a science fiction film.\n\n\"To Infinity\" visually opens up, though, when the father must finally say goodbye to his daughter. As the light floods in and the shots widen to reveal the larger surroundings, we finally see the nature of their mission. The revelation is heart-wrenching, showing just what a parent will do to ensure their child has a better life -- and making it clear that parental love knows no language, boundaries or barriers.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

His life in the balance, Maryam initially makes a few attempts to help, but the weights are too heavy and stuck. She watches as he dies before her eyes -- giving her a moral dilemma, and a chance to remake her life.\n\nWritten and directed by Kaveh Mazaheri and co-produced by the Iranian Youth Cinema Society, this short drama seems, on its surface, a domestic-slice-of-life story disrupted by a quiet yet undeniably disturbing incident. But as it progresses, it becomes a fascinating character portrait of a woman at a crossroads in her life, presented with an opportunity to change everything.\n\nThe film rests on lead actor Sonia Sanjari, who plays Maryam with a remarkable silence and stillness. With both precision and economy, she portrays Maryam as a compliant woman with little voice in her life, who has always done what she has been told to do without much recourse for protest or complaint.\n\nAround Sanjari's top-notch performance, Mazaheri constructs a remarkably intelligent, uniquely engaging film, making strong and memorable directorial decisions at every turn. As the film opens, the documentary-like camera chooses to focus on the husband, as he lobs a stream of small yet persistent demands for Maryam's caretaking as she tries to get her toddler to eat.\n\nBut the film shifts to Maryam at its pivotal moment, the camera and editing choose to stay on Maryam's face, the moment capturing the complexity of Maryam's response: first her ineffectual helplessness, and then her removed, distant blankness as her husband dies before her eyes. Her multifaceted, layered reaction says much about not just who she is, but what her life with her husband was like for her. It is a masterful acting moment, handled with great delicacy, honesty and bravery by a gifted actress.\n\nAfter witnessing what she does, Maryam proceeds through the rest of the day, carrying her secret. The discrepancy between what she and the audience knows and the everyday life around her creates a narrative question of what she will do with her secret. But it is a testament to the film's almost forensic emotional precision that it doesn't drive the film forward in a traditional way.\n\nInstead, its interest remains with Maryam, as well as the quotidian rhythms and concerns of Iranian life and the way women proceed within it, fitting themselves around persistent, small pressures that, collectively, exert a great weight -- a weight that perhaps pushes Maryam to make her final decision.\n\nSituating \"Retouch\" in a rich and fascinating film tradition like Iran's is beyond the scope of a review, but like many of Iran's greatest films, it operates from both an objective, dispassionate distance and a subtle, understated intimacy, using both storytelling lenses to provoke questions, create productive tensions and test compassion.\n\nAn uneasy, riveting triumph of short-form storytelling, the emotions \"Retouch\" evokes are complex and unforgettable as the story, as it brings up disbelief, moral horror and yet genuine heartbreak as well.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She is accompanied by Yun, her South Korean mother, for an important engagement, one that may make her professional future.\n\nBut Hyun-ah begins to rebel in her small way against the constant pressure and lack of understanding. At first, her rebellion happens through passive refusal, but eventually, it leads to a larger confrontation and a growing schism between parent and child.\n\nWriter-director Minha Kim's dreamy, atmospheric dramatic short examines the consequences and pressures of familial sacrifice between generations, using remarkable visual acuity and narrative economy to construct a portrait of parent-child alienation.\n\nShot on 35mm, the film has a gorgeous, grainlike haze and drift to its visuals and rhythm, ambling from one crystalline image to another. The softness evokes the suppleness of childhood memory, capturing the young protagonist's impressions of her journey: the way shadows dance on the way, the beautiful distortions of city lights through a window. The abstract, poetic approach fractures time and space in the way that childhood memory organizes experience: not through strict chronology or cause-and-effect, but through sensation and emotion.\n\nBut the visual beauty overlays an emotional tension and sadness, one that comes from Hyun-ah's central dilemma. Her familial unit is one where everyone sacrifices something to be successful, but despite it all, no one is happy. Under immense pressure to succeed, it inevitably causes tension in the family. Actors Minhee Yeo and Sarah Sol Kim, who play young daughter and mother, respectively, capture this conflict in a sensitive, emotionally perceptive way, in performances full of subtlety and precision.\n\nIn a subtle way, the story also contextualizes this familial dynamic as not just psychological but sociological. The mother character may seem harsh and punitive, but she exists in a value system where the father is the sole provider and unavailable physically and emotionally, the mother exists only to care for and ensure the future of her child and the pressure to be successful at all costs is enormous. Those costs become clear as the young daughter -- who speaks very little in the film -- attempts to make herself heard in a world where no one really sees her for who she is.\n\n\"A Perfect Turn\" is a film about a kid, but even with its gentle, poetic flow of images that evokes a childlike subjectivity, it's not a children's film, focused as it is on a family's dysfunction and its effect on Hyun-ah. Beautiful, melancholy and quiet, it is a tremendously sad film, but one that is valuable in raising questions on just what success is -- especially when it fails to bring any happiness.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The moments of conflict expose the fault lines in the family, whether it's between traditionalists who hold onto their culture with an iron grip or the younger generations that are struggling to stay in touch with the old traditions.\n\nBut her defiance also makes way for a small moment of grace, giving her comfort and acceptance during her near unbearable loss.\n\nWriter-director Robert Nazar Arjoyan's family drama explores not just the difficult trajectory of grief and the strange moments of hope to be found within such a devastating arc, but also the line between traditions and superstitions.\n\nThe storytelling takes us intimately into Armenian culture, a milieu not often portrayed on film. Essentially one long pivotal scene in Elena's life, the rich writing, camerawork and musical score gently weave its way between the different family members, who each seem to encapsulate a different relationship with cultural heritage. Some grasp onto traditions with an iron grip, but others have a lighter, looser interpretation.\n\nThis panorama approach is emphasized by the film's visual style, which often emphasizes wider group shots over more intimate face-ups. While lead actress Anne Bedian's excellent performance as Elena forms the emotional arc that we hang the story upon, what's also important is the context that the story exists in.\n\nThe wider view allows the film to look at how tightly Armenian traditionalists hold onto their culture, understandable given their tumultuous, troubled history in the world. But after fighting so hard to keep their heritage alive, it asks why it is so difficult to question traditions as the world evolves, and what role questioners and rebels have within this.\n\nThe writing, too, allows its revelations and development to unravel gradually, letting background information and relationships unfold through its kaleidoscope of interactions and conversations. Gradually, the audience comes to understand the depth of Elena's loss, and just how much Sevan will be missed by her partner, family and community -- a depth revealed in the film's last encounter, which finally gives Elena the comfort and acceptance she needs.\n\n\"I Promised Her Life\" tells the story of a grieving mother, the dead daughter she hardly knew and just how far a parent will go to make things right. But by overlaying an intimate cultural aspect over the universal emotions of love and grief, it gives viewers a chance to examine their own inheritances of how they acknowledge death and grief -- as well as finding our balance in letting tradition versus our own actions define us.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The regime's leader, Pol Pot, establishes the ideology and regime of Angka, which separates families into forced labor camps, where they are worked to death, face starvation or are tortured and executed.\n\nIn the midst of turbulent political winds, one doctor, along with his apprentice,  keeps on helping the sick and poor in his village, healing them with tinctures and other homemade medicines despite the crippling poverty, starvation and danger they face.\n\nBut then he is faced with curing the wife of one of the government soldiers, who knows what camp the doctor's family is imprisoned at -- and who also killed the families of many people in the village. His apprentice doesn't want to help the dying woman, seeing her as the enemy, but the doctor is desperate to survive and find out where the rest of his family is. As they argue, the wife overhears their conversation, eventually calling them traitors and leading to a calamitous chain of events.\n\nWriter-director Robin Veret, along with producer Florence Chea, has painstakingly crafted a political drama that captures a horrific chapter of world history through the eyes of its victims. Like feature films \"The Killing Fields\" and \"First They Killed My Father,\" it offers a window into how the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against its own population, killing an estimated 1.6 to 1.8 million people in the four years it was in power.\n\nWith stunning photography and quiet, observant direction, the film is a deceptively simple story, based on the true account of a doctor, with details changed to protect anonymity. But though its narrative scope is confined to one turning point in one man's life -- and though it remains at an understated emotional register, refusing to fall into melodrama -- the story resonates with the force of history and truth, becoming emblematic of how the Khmer Rouge devastated the country, both politically, economically and emotionally.\n\nMuch of the film's power is drawn from its sense of authenticity, both in fact and feeling. Shot in the suburbs of Phnom Penh with an excellent cast of Cambodian actors, the film eschews a documentary-like immediacy. Its more meditative pacing and carefully composed images instead evoke both the weight of the past, as well as lead effectively into slow horror as the doctor -- a compassionate healer by profession and temperament -- faces his final, terrible choice.\n\n\"Sons of April\" is a powerful political portrait in the form of a poetic, devastating short drama, which leverages the power of cinematic storytelling to create an almost unthinkable experience for the audience. So often when we read or learn about genocide -- especially when the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 or 1979 came to light -- and we often wonder how such horror and dehumanization could happen. The power of this short drama is to show that it happened one incident after another, which add up to a crushing tragedy -- and growing piles of innocent bodies in mass graves.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He begins to fear for her mental health and even her life, fearing she will harm herself -- or worse, commit suicide.\n\nHe tries to intervene, but his actions set off an unpredictable game of cat-and-mouse between teacher and student. With each move in this evolving game of power, the dynamic between the pair escalates to strange, unexpected places -- especially as it's increasingly played out on social media, with calamitous results.\n\nDirector Jonatan Etzler -- along with writers Amanda Hogbert and Axel Nygren -- has fashioned a taut, compelling thriller that scrutinizes the ravenous hunger for attention and distinction, particularly as it intersects with the mores of social media fame, the impact on mental health and the manipulation capable with video and public narratives. It seems to begin as a straightforward narrative about bullying and a feel-good intervention by a caring adult on behalf of a passive victim. But as it proceeds, it twists like a Moebius strip onto itself, revealing a dark yet riveting underbelly.\n\nChilling and incisive, this is a dark, psychologically disturbing narrative, rendered in a darkly muted, shadowy color palette and coolly clinical and disciplined camerawork, both of which suit the subject matter and the somber Swedish setting.\n\nBut the foundation is an excellent storyline and script, which is adroitly constructed and well-paced in its writing and editing. Possessing superb character insight, as well as an acute eye for how the arena of social attention shapes action and behavior, the narrative is alive to how teenagers jockey for status through their social media, how easily posts, videos and \"content\" can be weaponized -- and how easily perceptions can be manipulated to shift and mold the sympathies of the viewer.\n\nThe film's own storytelling exhibits a tight control over the release of information and insight, playing with our own understanding of what's going on and why. This masterful shifting is aided and abetted by two superb lead performances. Actor Shanti Roney plays the teacher with both great compassion and sensitivity, but the revelation is young performer Miriam Benthe as Vendela, who manages the difficult trick of offering insight, nuance and moments of both surprising vulnerability and callous amorality with subtlety and skill. She takes what could easily be a nasty, unsubtle role and parlays it into something much more complex and compelling.\n\nA winner at the 2018 Student Academy Awards, \"Get Ready With Me\" is an immaculately crafted work of cinema, made with precision and discernment. It's also a deft, keenly intelligent thriller, whose storytelling prowess is enough to keep viewers pulled along through unpredictable waters and whose arc has unusual depth and movement for a short.\n\nBut its real strength lies in its ability to provoke thought and discussion. It asks age-old questions of how far people will go to fit in, but its responsiveness to the current cultural moment may cause us all to question just what kind of world we are creating with each post, like and comment. The film is too smart and perceptive to offer answers, but instead lets its questions sit uneasily in both memory and conscience, letting them gnaw at the margins of awareness.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But during her time, she doesn't plan on visiting the sights and sounds of the city. Instead, she plans on working -- and she decides to earn the most amount of money that she can by working in underground motels.\n\nWhen she arrives, she wants to make a phone call, but the phone booth is broken. As she is drawn into her temporary new life, guided by a \"groom\" named Tat, she keeps trying to make her call. But as she delves deeper into the netherworld of Hong Kong, it becomes seemingly harder to reach out.\n\nWriter-director Timothy Yeung's powerful short drama -- also co-written by Yinuo Wang, who stars in the main role -- manages to combine one young girl's quiet yet harrowing emotional journey with a skillfully subtle yet memorable portrayal of a hidden world.\n\nThe storytelling has an almost documentary-like attention to detail, aided by an expressionistic usage of murky, lurid lighting and cinematography. The noirish yet strangely captivating camera shots often capture the cramped, cluttered rooms and hallways of Li Jan's new workplace or the smeared, oily-looking back alleys she and her minder walk to get from one hotel to another. There's little sense of Hong Kong as a city; instead, we're dropped like Li Jan into one of the hidden worlds hiding in plain sight.\n\nThough it's very matter-of-fact about the underground and its surprisingly mundane aspects, the film avoids tawdriness by paying close attention to the characters and their interactions with one another. The performances of the main cast are beautifully nuanced and resolutely human, revealing layers of conflict and longing. These are people overwhelmed by what they're doing, yet do offer flickers of humanity, connection and understanding with one another. But never too much, however: the business of buying and selling women's bodies requires a certain level of detachment from everyone involved.\n\nThat detachment forms the heart of the emotional arc in \"90 Days,\" delineated with heartbreaking precision through excellent writing, directing and acting all around. The final moments of the film -- from the cigarette that Li Jan asks for to the bright tone she forces in her voice when she finally gets to make her phone call -- are completely subtle in scale as gestures, yet they're momentous in emotion. The story ends on the first night of Li Jan's 90-day stay. Yet the film's triumph is leaving viewers to wonder just how those three months will affect her long after they're over.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But in the course of his duties -- and while being distracted by a conversation with a very talkative skater turning in a lost item -- he spots a suspicious-looking man with a backpack across the rink.\n\nWhen the man begins acting oddly, the employee's mind begins to imagine something nefarious, wondering if a potential catastrophe may just be happening before his eyes.\n\nWriter-director Joosje Duk's sharply focused psychological drama -- produced by Achmed Akkabi, Quintin Baker and Tamar Guttmann -- is essentially about fear, and how fear can shape the perception of events in people's minds, warping realities into pre-existing and not always accurate narratives.\n\nHere, the narrative is the discourse around terrorism in general -- a highly topical and relevant subject, given recent events throughout Europe. But the film's strength and skill aren't about dogma or ideology. Instead, its intelligent, precise writing adroitly evokes an internal experience of fear and imagination, constantly modulating it with a sure-handed control of information and causing viewers to question just how much we can trust our own perceptions at times.\n\nThe storytelling is able to enter into the employee's point-of-view, thanks to subtle yet commanding direction and editing. Shot in an unobtrusive, seemingly naturalistic style, the choices of shot and sequencing constantly upends the expectations of objectivity that such a style evokes.\n\nInstead, the style reveals itself as actually quite stylized as the film progresses, sticking to rigorously clean and simple angles within two main camera positions during the bulk of the narrative. As the action progresses and we observe the reactions of the employee -- not to mention his distraction -- we see and experience how the employee makes meaning of what he's seeing. As viewers, we are held to what he sees and knows, and soon we are swept up with him into a quietly effective and tense potential disaster sequence.\n\n\"Thin Ice\" could be considered a political film, but it is less about policy and more about the intersection of ideas and tropes with personal perception. Through this self-contained short, we experience just how emotionally powerful tropes can root themselves in the mind, with the fear they evoke affecting how we interpret and relate to the world and people outside of us.\n\nThough the events obliquely referenced by \"Thin Ice\" are recent and still relevant, watching prejudice play out as a mental and emotional process is almost universal to any experience in which events, people and behavior are reshaped to fit a template, rather than being seen for themselves.\n\nThis is a thought-provoking film, but it provokes not through incendiary rhetoric but through its own curious, lucid questioning of just how reliable human perception and interpretation can be. It ends with a dark, almost thriller-like note that further destabilizes just what we and the main character know and causes us to question if what we watched was \"real\" -- and perhaps interrogates the very notion of absolute certainty itself during a time of constant anxiety and fear.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But as the trip progresses and the pair inevitably clashes, long-simmer feelings begin to emerge, and neither father nor son is equipped to traverse the distance that has grown between them. Their inability to break through to one another bubbles up into a much larger confrontation -- and illuminates a bigger impasse than either ever imagined.\n\nWriter-director Samuel Grandchamp's drama is both a road trip journey in its stunning visuals and a chamber drama in its intimate emotional scale, focused as it is on the push and pull between two characters who long to bridge the chasm between themselves but only succeed in widening it.\n\nIts strength as a narrative lies in its sharply acute yet nuanced observation of unspoken feelings, and how these undercurrents well up and shape their interactions with one another.\n\nThis emotional intelligence is woven in its excellent writing, which skillfully reveals a relationship eventually defined by its gaps and chasms, as well a naturalistic visual approach that, besides being beautiful to look at, feels often like a clear-eyed documentary of a strained relationship and a broken family.\n\nThe camera and editing are elegantly pared-down and precise, focusing especially on the son's reactions. This micro-currents of feeling are brought to life by an excellent performance by young actor Alessio Balossi, who is able to evoke the boy's excitement and hopes at seeing the dam and spending time with his father figure -- as well as the disappointment he feels in his father's words and behavior when he reacts to conflict.\n\nInstead of openness or honesty, however, the father leans on the traditional power of the parental role to maintain control of the situation -- which only opens up a long-dormant wellspring of conflict that drives a wedge further between the duo, one that doesn't bode well in the future for either.\n\n\"The Big Dam\" is very much about fathers, sons and broken families, and its ending is quiet and all the more heartbreaking for being so delicately rendered. Breaking up a family is a sadly common occurrence in modern society, but rarely are its long-term consequences portrayed with such insight and lucidity. Despite an undeniable amount of love, there just isn't an easy fix for the significant absence of a parent in a child's life, and no trip can take the place of patient, steady investment of attention and care into such an important bond.\n\nWhen the foundation of a relationship isn't solid, the small fissures and cracks that form take on greater significance -- and can't easily be repaired, despite the best of intentions.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

When he objects, she throws a fit and runs away, which escalates into a full-blown tantrum, complete with bystanders' broken jars and a slap.\n\nThe slap draws the attention of other shoppers, one of which threatens to report the father for child abuse. Soon the incident becomes an argument, which draws in other people in the shop. One fight leads to another, and soon the whole thing blows up into a major outburst in the neighborhood.\n\nWriter-director Christophe M. Saber's sharp, witty short files itself under the category of comedy, but its humor isn't based on punchlines or pratfalls. Instead, it mines a certain vein of ironic social observation, capturing a pressure cooker of underlying societal and personal tensions that come boiling to the surface to unpredictable effect.\n\nThe ensemble of characters is especially large for a short, and they all function less on the level of psychological depth and more as social types. The story doesn't get deep inside any one character's head, instead, focusing on the interactions between them.\n\nTo this end, the acting overall is especially skilled, able to evoke the archetypes that make up this particular slice of Swiss society -- a harried father, a well-to-do wealthy couple, Arab immigrants, \"native\" Europeans -- while seeming specific and believable. The writing is especially skilled at injecting how certain social attitudes and sentiments in Swiss society underlie how people talk to and treat one another, leading to conflicts that on the surface seem about one thing and yet are about something else entirely.\n\nCapturing this cauldron of types as they rub up against one another in an increasingly volatile space is no mean feat, but the energetic documentary-style camerawork -- very much like one-camera improv-style television comedies like Arrested Development -- tracks the small moments that reveal opposing attitudes and conflicts between the characters, all while keeping the action brisk and well-paced.\n\nWhere the storytelling excels, though, is capturing how these tensions shape-shift and transmit across lines like a contagion. A father's irritation sparks a broken jar, a slap and a child's cry, which then draws the attention of a nosy wealthy woman, whose sparks the enmity of the mother and wife who comes in, irritated by her husband.\n\nBy the time all the action moves outside, the carefully constructed edifice of tension and anger is set to erupt with one careless word or gesture -- and erupt it does, in an unforgettable, exuberantly fractious melee that must be seen to be believed.\n\n\"Discipline\" is both tense to watch, with all its arguing, and yet mordantly funny, especially as we watch underlying conflict and tension erupt into increasingly outlandish and yet wholly believable petty human behavior. Watching this panorama of conflict spill out across the screen at the film's end is both a hilarious, almost farcical sight. Yet it also suggests that the edifice that makes up social order is held together by a thin, fragile pretense of civility, one that is easily punctured by prejudices and perspectives about others not like us.\n\nThe film is ambivalent about whether or not humanity can transcend such facile tribalism, especially considering how easily we can allow our irritations to lose control and transform into full-blown meltdowns -- not unlike children.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Meanwhile her husband -- who shuttles the salon employees back and forth from their homes to their workplace -- may be sleeping with one of her younger employees, who has a secret of her own.\n\nWriter-director Lu Han offers a piercing, intimate look at the emotional life of a couple who have come to the U.S. and established the foothold of a better life, but are struggling with the next step of building a family together.\n\nThe film is built on strong, sensitively calibrated performances, which often underplay the roiling emotions and situations the characters are dealing with. The approach celebrates the everyday interactions, glances, silences and gestures that actually build or destroy our relationships, turning what could be melodrama into a beautifully observed chamber piece.\n\nWhen the film's main character suspects all is not right in the workplace she runs or the marriage she's trying to hold together, she has a choice to either turn to bitterness or grow towards compassion. Lead actor Alice Ko charts Wenhua's arc with precision, and the result in an honest journey into one woman's grappling with the truth and what that means for the life she and her husband have built for themselves in the U.S.\n\nIt also offers a window in the workings of a seemingly innocuous space that most Americans take for granted. Nail salons are everywhere, whether in the strip malls of suburbia or nestled on the corners of busy streets. They're tucked away and often busy, thanks to their cheap prices and quick service.\n\nBut Lu Han adds complexity to the picture, showing the hard work and behind-the-scenes struggles of the people who run them. Combined with the tense emotional drama deftly portrayed in the film, the salon becomes a pressure cooker: a trap, as well as an opportunity to progress in life.\n\nThe result is a film that's not just about one woman's shift in how she sees herself and her marriage, but a rich examination of what it means to be in a community and find emotional sustenance in it. At the film's end, nothing concrete is resolved -- but each character finds a different understanding of what it means to care and be responsible for one another.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

For security reasons, Nino isn't told the date or hour of the president's arrival and is not allowed to tell anyone else.\n\nOf course, Nino tells one of his fellow villagers, and the news spreads. Soon the whole town frantically prepares for the president's visit: everyone dresses up, festoons the village with flags and posters of the president, all with the intent of impressing the president. They embark on their own campaigns to get the president's attention, much to the consternation of Nino, who clearly endangered the confidentiality he was supposed to keep.\n\nUnable to keep the village under control, the rivalries and tensions latent between people bubble up. And in the chaos, the village's attempts to clean up its image backfires -- although the village doesn't quite see it that way.\n\nAbsurdist political comedy is not often a genre you see in short films, but writer-director Cyril Aris's short does a remarkable job of encapsulating a wide-ranging political situation within one event and pushing its premise to the most extreme end, with humorous yet sharply insightful results.\n\nThere's no shortage of excellent craftsmanship in the film, with its elegant cinematography and stately editing, and there is a studied, almost mannered quality to the compositions that will remind some of Wes Anderson. The village itself functions much like a collective protagonist, and while Nino is the main character, visually there's an emphasis on wide and group shots, or shots that situate Nino in a moving tableau of village life.\n\nThe visuals are subtly stylized and striking, but the foundational strength of the short rests on its exceptional writing, which possesses a keen eye for the absurdities created by human vanity and an ear for the hypocrisies we tell one another in the service of ego. The narrative scale is confined to one visit, but the script's ability to create layers of subtlety and context is remarkably complex. Though it's played for laughs, the villagers' frenzy feels very true to a societal portrait of humankind's worst impulses -- impulses that can't be kept in check, resulting in chaos and damage that is blithely overlooked in the face of power.\n\nThe take on politics in \"The President's Visit\" is ultimately astringent in its sharpness,  and though the film plays out much like a comedy, its portrayal of a populace's willingness to kowtow to power even to their own detriment is essentially a tragedy -- one hinted at the film's resonant final shots. It also emerges as a parable about the willingness of people to blindly follow a leader, no matter how problematic he or she is.\n\nThough \"The President's Visit\" has the feel of a fable in its stylization at times, it's rooted in real life: there's plenty of examples of a lack of critical thought in yesterday's history or today's news, which makes the film's wry humor both a consolation and despair.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But he's anxious to get back to his girlfriend and his job in Europe.\n\nBut navigating the bureaucracy of his mother's healthcare is a slow and frustrating process, and he's suing his mother's insurance provider for not covering the costs of Miriam's assisted-living home. Miriam, too, is aware that Javier has given up a lot to come to Buenos Aires to care for her.\n\nCaught in a limbo between his loyalty and obligation to his mother and the life he has left behind in Vienna, Javier finds himself wrestling with complicated emotions, made even more difficult because of the bureaucratic hurdles he faces.\n\nWriter-director Franco Volpi's palpably affecting and empathetic drama concerns the difficult internal tug-of-war when the roles between parents and child change. Taking a subtle, understated approach to the emotions and refusing an easy sense of catharsis, it nevertheless achieves a powerful resonance in its recognition of an emotional complexity with no easy answers, and its depiction of the unspoken intimacies of family relationships, and the way that closeness both compels and stifles.\n\nA sense of naturalism pervades the film at all levels, from the studied yet muted camerawork to the way the writing nestles quotidian details within moments of tension. There's also a dry, almost absurdist sense of humor as well, along with a sharp eye for the way an impersonal governmental or corporate policy can ripple into the most personal of situations, creating seismic disturbances in the people they affect. Having to get a new prescription from the doctor with a proper date seems like no problem to company bureaucrats, but waiting a week to see a doctor for vital medication is potential agony for both Miriam and Javier.\n\nThe heart of the film is found in the mother-son relationship depicted in the story and brought to life by actors Miguel Di Lemma and Silvina Sabater. Neither performer erupts into histrionics or makes grand speeches, but their work is precise, subtle and deeply affecting. Javier's exhaustion can edge into resentment, but it's entirely understandable. Meanwhile, Miriam has a heartbreaking, helpless self-awareness of her illness and its impact on her family. Yet all the sadness is borne out of a deep core of love -- one that arises from a tiny yet tender moment at the film's end.\n\nThe touching ending of \"August Sun\" is a perfect grace note and a fitting emblem for a film remarkable for its blend of social awareness, emotional realism and compassionate honesty. (It is also, sadly, all too relatable for many navigating complex healthcare systems around the world.) There are no easy feelings here, and no solutions -- just a constant, steady recognition that all we can do is our best during such difficult situations.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Likewise, the village is unsympathetic and, on the day of the funeral for Yohana's father, decides to enact their own rough brand of justice. They will take the outsider out on a boat, attach a rope with seven knots to him and push him into the water -- and it is up to Yohana to save his life, or not.\n\nVisually stunning and thrillingly taut in its storytelling, writer-director James Morgan's short drama explores the liminal space between tradition and modernity, outsiders and community and right and wrong.\n\nImpeccably crafted, It functions as a thriller in its life-and-death stakes and its tightly controlled editing and pacing, but it also evokes a fragile, mesmerizing world whose very soul seems to hang in the balance of Yohana's decision. The cinematography and camerawork are simply exquisite in capturing the unforgiving, isolated beauty of the Arctic, and with its stunning vistas and dramatic seascapes, we easily see why the villagers will fight so hard to preserve it.\n\nYet the outside world is clearly encroaching, as the presence of the outsider represents. The film presents him to viewers at first in the same way that the villagers see him: inscrutable, unconcerned and unfeeling. But as the narrative unfolds -- and each story beat counts, with each detail, line and performance deftly conveying character and culture and building suspense -- we perhaps sense that all isn't what it seems and that there are perhaps other hidden agendas at work.\n\nYohana is the center of the narrative, and her decisions as a character power the story forward. Yet she is a young woman asked to make an impossible, almost cripplingly heavy decision, one that will be the making of her, and may likely set off a chain of events that shifts the history of her village. In many ways, she is asked to grow up in a very short space of time -- and determine the fate of her and her village as well.\n\nThe ritual portrayed in \"Seven\" is fictionalized, but it seems almost ancient and primal in its intensity and its directness. As a fascinating meditation on justice, it both offers an understanding of how satisfying more immediate, visceral brands of retribution can feel -- but also how it can be manipulated and even abused.\n\nThe unforgettable setting of \"Seven,\" which becomes a character in its own right, also can't help but exert its own point of contemplation. In a world characterized by an increasingly global connection, what are the stakes that come with isolation? When does an insistence on tradition become a hindrance to a seemingly inexorable future? As a piece of filmmaking, the film ably draws viewers in and answers the immediate question of what happens next -- but it leaves these broader philosophical questions hanging in the pale light and cold air of the Arctic, to be considered with an unsettling yet intelligent thoughtfulness.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Together they explore haunted buildings, skip school and investigate local mysteries, one of which is a mutant with superpowers, a man with a deep wound on his face. They try to bring him home, keeping him safe and to themselves.\n\nBut when the two boys get caught up in the small-time world of neighborhood gangs and bullies, they pull their strange new friend into the conflict and discover that they may actually be right about the mysterious man they've adopted as their own.\n\nWritten and directed by Luca Nappa, this magical realist short grafts two unlikely genres onto one another, with fascinating, emotionally compelling results. There's a strong strand of children's fantasy, particularly inspired by 80s classics like \"E.T.,\" in how the storytelling puts its kid protagonists' emotions, imaginations and concerns at the center of the story, with the magical aspect amplifying the impact of their actions and ingenuity.\n\nBut the fantastical elements are overlaid over a base of Italian neorealism, which offers a steady, sustained, almost unflinching observation of the social milieu of Naples, where the story takes place. Documenting the daily life of the people and places often forgotten by history and politics, these conditions give new life and shape to the children's fantasy genre, offering fresh perspectives on both cinematic storytelling traditions and sociopolitical realities.\n\nThe heritage of neorealism is especially notable in the film's visuals, which have an almost documentary-like acuity and clarity of detail. The gritty yet luminous cinematography and camera movement capture the Sanita area, putting viewers in close quarters with the ramshackle yet enduring homes, streets, noise, and buildings where the two boys grow up within.\n\nThe two actors playing the boys -- nonprofessional performers Francesco Capaldo and Vincenzo Quaranta -- have a spiky yet loyal bond and portray both the energy and innocence of youth mixed with a certain toughness and street smarts, and it's a pleasure to watch them spar and strategize together as they attempt to pull their \"mutant\" into their orbit.\n\nThe mutant, of course, is mysterious and magical to them, and that is partly because they don't immediately grasp his social situation. It is a unique view through which to situate the idea of a migrant, a figure that exists on the margins of an already marginal world and who seems inscrutable and enigmatic in both their silence and their need to stay hidden.\n\nActor Saeid Haselpour has the job of playing both the mysterious mutant's social reality and his status as a figure of imagination and strange fascination to the two boys (and the difficult task of performing without any dialogue.) Yet the fascination he exerts make him a valuable pawn in the emerging battles in the streets of Sanita, and threaten to reveal him to the world at large.\n\n\"Warriors of Sanita\" is very much a children's fantasy story, where the huge, overwhelming aspects of the world or life are integrated into understanding with unique, resonant and creative ways. As the two boys slowly make sense of their mutant and his place in the world, what emerges is a powerful parable about how the world works -- and how it often treats those marginalized and forgotten in the shadows and cracks of society.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Still deep in mourning, she believes the surgeon who operated on her mother was beset by evil forces. Immersed in contemporary superhero imagery and stories, she decided to fight these \"monsters\" by becoming a superhero vigilante out to avenge her mother.\n\nMaya takes on some criminals on her own, managing to triumph in her adventures. But when she confronts a group of opponents that may be beyond her capacity, she may have to call on a different set of powers to overcome them.\n\nWriter-director Tara Shehata's children's fantasy short (co-written with Andrew McGee) is not just an adventure about finding one's inner magic and strength, but with its specific cultural milieu and flavor, it's a keen-eyed examination of women's place in Egyptian society, seen through the eyes of a young girl who wants to fight back against the oppressors who surround her.\n\nMany fantasy films are shot with a sheen and polish that form the backdrop for stunning special effects. But the film takes a more naturalistic approach to its visuals, emphasizing Cairo's weathered textures and gritty surroundings. Social context is key here -- this is a story as much about contemporary Egypt as it is about Maya's own personal journey through grief, pain and anger.\n\nThe storytelling adeptly balances these dual strands, capturing Maya's emotional and imaginative world through beautifully observed scenes, poignant details and the occasional flight of whimsy in the form of personal animated flourishes. The combination has both a handmade DIY charm and an eye for the poetic that is unique to the genre and emphasizes both Maya's innocence and precociousness.\n\nMaya's gift is that she's able to recognize the larger societal forces that shape her world, even if she can't quite articulate why they're unjust or oppressive. Like many children and young people, she has an innate sense of fairness, which she responds to with a directness of action. Young actor Yasmina El-Abd's performance also has a clarity to it, which makes for a kind of moral power. She may not have the ability to fly or be invisible, but she possesses the power of conviction.\n\nThe scope of her battles remains charmingly smaller in scale, but when Maya gets more ambitious and takes on something that may be larger than her powers, \"The Shadow of Cairo\" at its climax reveals the limitations of the fantasy superhero genre. It's not exactly a move into social realism, but an acknowledgment that a mostly Americanized genre -- and its focus on the individual -- can only impact society so much. Instead, Maya draws upon something larger than herself -- and learns a valuable lesson about community, collective action and connection, one that pulls her out of her isolating grief and back into the larger world.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But with no money, an absent father and a mother too overwhelmed by poverty, Tara is also set to marry a much older man soon, despite her age.\n\nOn the eve of her wedding, Tara's 17-year-old sister Krishna arrives in the village, pregnant herself from her own marriage as a child bride. As the pair reunite and reconnect, reconciling old differences and memories, Krishna challenges Tara's marriage, as she seeks to free her sister from the fate she has suffered herself.\n\nFilmed on location in the Sunderbans Delta in India, this gorgeous, compelling drama by writer-director Souvid Datta captures a corner of the world not often seen by Western audiences, as well as brings considerable shape and feeling to the issue of child brides, who are deprived of their full potential and life when married off before they're physically or emotionally ready to become wives and mothers.\n\nThough child marriage is the dramatic axis of the conflict that powers the film's narrative forward, this short film itself doesn't deprive its power just from its moral clarity. With moody, saturated hues, hazy and expressionistic lighting and a dynamic sense of movement, it offers impeccable cinematic craftsmanship as well, rendering this milieu with a sensuous attention to detail, sound and texture. Its tapestry of beautiful images and sounds -- combined with a poetic, almost impressionistic approach to editing and pacing -- immerses viewers intimately in the story and place, helping viewers to understand the context and emotional stakes of what's happening.\n\nOut of this pleasing blur of sound and image, the story of these sisters emerges like a kaleidoscope settling into a clear pattern. The narrative structure is fairly ambitious, weaving between past and present, but it knits together a portrait of a strong bond between sisters, capturing the spirit of two strong, intelligent girls. Portrayed by actors Priyanka Roy and Ratna Chakraborty as Tara and Krishna, respectively, these two sisters are so vividly alive onscreen that we understand why being married off so young is such a tragedy in their lives -- and root for them even more as they push against the norms that may condemn them to such limited, circumscribed lives.\n\nBeyond the emotional trauma and tragedy, being married off too young often perpetuates intergenerational cycles of poverty, since young girls often are deprived of education and social support and cannot develop the networks and skills to help them find better opportunities. Yet in South Asia, for example, nearly 30 percent of young women were married off before the age of 18, according to UNICEF.\n\n\"Moonlight Dreams\" brings these issues and statistics to life, in a way that grounds us emotionally in what's at stake for young girls like Tara. But more than that, it is a vivid portrait of sisterly love and loyalty, and the strength that exists between women, as they fight to be free, make choices and develop to their fullest potential -- in their own time, and in the way that best suits them.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Sganarell runs a small tobacco shop in town, where he organizes and takes care of Doni's affairs, including dealing with the fallout of Doni's many paramours.\n\nBut one day two women show up at the same time in the tobacco shop. Isabelle pops in, and then her romantic rival Charlotte does as well. The two women don't know one another, and Doni's best friend would like to keep it that way. But the shop's close quarters -- and the ardent affection of the two rivals -- may get in the way.\n\nWriter-director Guy Lichtenstein's comedic short has a farcically awkward situation at its center, as the shopkeeper struggles to keep his friend's romantic whirlwind aloft without crashing too many of its more delicate elements into one another.\n\nIn the hands of a less assured and clumsier filmmaker, such a set-up would be whipped into a froth of farce or slapstick. But here, it's executed with a sense of discerning understatement and wry intelligence that elevates it into a sharply amusing portrait of one friend cleaning up another's mess -- and perhaps learning the limits of his loyalty.\n\nAs far as comedies go, it's fairly muted, hitting its comic moments with a lightness and even delicacy of touch. The approach isn't overly silly or overplayed, thanks to a tight script studded with small but telling character moments, brought to life by perceptive, understated performances all around. Like many comedies, the heart of the drama is all about awkwardness, but while a different comedic approach would warp the characters into caricatures of themselves, Sganarell here rarely loses his smooth equanimity in dealing with a potentially disastrous situation. There's a cool professionalism that he's developed from being Doni's friend and perhaps cleaning up his personal messes over the year -- which in and of itself is a funny comment.\n\nThe emphasis on subtlety extends to the film's sense of craftsmanship, which is actually quite beautiful, though it never parades its excellence as a distraction from the story. The camerawork and cinematography have a warmly tasteful, natural look and feel that never sacrifices its restraint, even when things get sticky for Sganarell. As the two women and rivals for Doni's affections realize just who the other is, Sganarell must extricate himself out of a complex web -- a situation he handles with a surprising equanimity and some quick thinking.\n\n\"Heart Issues\" is less a joke that pays off with a punchline, and more like a funny anecdote that you'd hear at a bar, laughing over life's foibles over a few drinks. As a comedy of errors, it works because it feels a lot like life itself, and the knotty, outlandish situations we can get into -- because people are weird, love is even weirder and sometimes our friends drive us crazy.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But he does know some English, so when the local priest asks his help translating during a confession from Bridget, who speaks only English, he's on hand to help.\n\nBut as the woman confesses, it's clear to both the priest and Antonio that she's dealing with a considerable moral dilemma. But as Antonio translates the priest's counsel, he begins to disagree with the priest and takes liberties with the translation -- a decision that just might change the course of their lives.\n\nWritten and directed by Francesco Gabriele -- who also plays the lead role --this charming short comedy has sharp and witty observations about religious influence in daily life in Italy, but ultimately it succeeds by making viewers smile, as a young man takes quick advantage of a situation to change his -- and another woman's -- luck for the better.\n\nThough there are moments of ribaldry and innuendo and some fun poked at Antonio's rather slacker-ish appearance, the humor in the writing is generally warm and affectionate, reminiscent of the community portrayed in the story. (This warmth is also a hallmark of the film's visual approach, whose handsome cinematography and graceful camerawork takes full advantage of the beautiful views and picturesque historical detail of its rural setting.)\n\nThe humor is not exactly wholesome, but it is grounded in the web of interconnections of the village: everyone knows everyone in this village and is familiar with their individual foibles and faults. Through this lens, Antonio comes off as a bit of an aimless layabout, much to his mother's exasperation.\n\nHe's played by Gabriele with a sheepish and sleepy charm, but there's also an innate brightness and intelligence in him -- a cleverness that's activated when actor Jennifer Ann Elmore shows up as the English-speaking woman in need of spiritual guidance. He seems to come to life, getting sharper and faster in his thinking as he grasps just what opportunity has fallen into his lap. Watching him go after what he wants and take his chance is highly entertaining, and even inspiring, as Antonio helps another find her own path, and puts himself finally on his own.\n\n\"Italian Miracle\" exists in a world that is cloistered, with some insularity, and part of Antonio's dilemma is that such an environment likely doesn't have a big enough arena to exert his intelligence and talents. But even tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the modern world, there's still a place for a tiny miracle to pop up in the middle of nowhere. But even divine intervention needs a human assist: it may take a little luck to spot it, and a little chutzpah to take advantage of it when the chance presents itself.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Once he had it all, but now he's drinking too much, bitter and cynical and relegated to working at a small local station.\n\nOne night during his broadcast, he gets a call from a man who claims he's going to kill his mother if Brian hangs up, takes him off the air or calls the police. But even this heightened situation manages to turn darker, pushing Brian to his limits and forcing him into an unexpected confrontation.\n\nWritten by Martijn Daamen and directed by Bastiaan Rook, this short thriller is both a character study of being at one's lowest point in life and marshaling your inner resources to overcome obstacles. Thanks to its genre bona-fides, the obstacles are particularly heightened and the stakes life-and-death and the writing and craftsmanship are beautifully woven together to maximize suspense. But ultimately it is a tale about a man who must learn to confront the source of malaise that he's been running from for awhile.\n\nThrillers are sometimes classified as a uniquely American genre, and there is a kind of roguish, rebellious quality in both the stylishly jagged filmmaking and Brian's characterization, which emphasizes a certain DGAF quality in him that is part rock 'n roll and part self-negligence and loathing. A propulsive score, a luridly cool approach to nighttime cinematography and editing that emphasizes contrast and energy are all elements that take their cues from classic 80s-eras L.A.-centric thrillers like Die Hard, which themselves were a more exuberantly violent offshoot of film noir. In many ways, the story could easily be imported into an American setting as well, with its international flair.\n\nBut there's an intelligence in the storytelling, and a willingness to delve deep into a character, that marks somewhat of a departure for the genre. Like other genres, there are twists and turns in the plot, but rather than coming from a somewhat convoluted manipulation of circumstances, the ones in this short are rooted deep within the main character's history and psychology, and force the character to look at himself in a way that he's avoided.\n\nWithout giving much away, Brian comes face to face with those shrouded dimensions of himself. Actor Sytse Faber's performance is one of unmasking, shedding the louche, cynical persona he carries, and ultimately digs deep into Brian's biggest regrets in the past. He unearths a vulnerability that can be rare in a relatively macho genre, making for a film that's as emotional as it is gripping.\n\n\"On Air\" ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger for a thriller. But when framed as a character sketch, it ends on Brian's most emotionally naked and unprotected moment, leaving viewers in the throes of both suspense and devastation. Ultimately, it is about the way we look into our past and confront the consequences of our actions.

But his little brother is tagging along, annoying him and incurring the relentless teasing of his friends.\n\nBut when little brother is finally run off and then confronts his bully, it leads to a dangerous situation -- one where Jon finally realizes what it means to be heroic.\n\nAn affectionate throwback to 80s films like Stand By Me, The Sandlot and The Goonies, Drew and Nate Garcia's short mashes together action, comedy and the well-placed moment of drama that explores the bonds between brothers and just what it means to be a hero.\n\nThe moments of comedy come from kids' approximation of the action scenes they're enacting with their play, whether it's soldiers advancing in the jungle of wartime or Nazis... in a car race in the desert.\n\nThough these scenes are shot with adult actors with the finesse and dynamism of a Hollywood action blockbuster, they're full of whimsical gestures and touches and played in the performance like children, with goofy dialogue and the direct, unfettered emotional quality of young kids. It's undeniably fun, but also a showcase for terrific craftsmanship, aided also by a fully conceived orchestral score that recalls the drama of John Williams and the plaintiveness of James Horner.\n\nThese action sequences punctuate the overall story of the brothers, with the little brother being pushed away by the big brother he admires and just wants to play with. It's a classic conflict, recognizable to anyone who's ever had a younger sibling, and though there are no surprises in terms of the emotional arc, it still achieves a heartwarming quality when Jon steps up to save his brother.\n\nIn \"Hero,\" Jon discovers that the essence of being one isn't being fearless or macho. Instead, heroism involves both heart and action: caring enough to endure pain and hardship to help another person or cause. Being a hero is being there when you're needed the most, looking outside for your own self-interest and struggling or working on behalf for who or what you love -- for Jon, and for many others, that means family.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Miro is one of these men, taken from his family and thrown onto the battlefield, where he risks his life at the front lines for a country that treats him as less than human and deprives him of his rights.\n\nBut when he returns back home, he discovers his land has been taken from him and his family spirited away from their home, relocated to a dangerous place where his wife and daughter are persecuted and preyed upon. Miro decides to rescue them, taking the bravery he's learned on the battlefield to mete out his own brand of justice.\n\nWriter-director Victoria Wharfe McIntyre's epic short mixes historical drama with the Western genre, making for a supremely stylish, engaging yet eye-opening look at a forgotten chapter and perspective in history. It has a contemporary energy in its movement and stylistic bravura, but a classicism in its epic sweep and power.\n\nThe visuals have the look and feel of a feature, with sweeping camerawork and bold, vivid cinematography that evoke everything from the tension of the battlefront to the dusty isolation of the Australian desert. The film is on the longer side for a short, and the scope of the narrative is also unusually wide-ranging, spanning a diverse range of locations and time. As a result, the pacing and events move quickly, keeping the audience on its toes and constantly ratcheting up the tension.\n\nThe audience is pulled through a vast historical and cultural tableau, and while there are beautiful images to tantalize the eye and action sequences that compel attention, viewers are also asked to consider the experience of WWII from a point-of-view not often chronicled in the history books.\n\nThough the dramatic treatment is heightened by Western flourishes, Miro's story is based on actual historical precedent and situations. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples served in both world wars well before they were considered citizens of Australia, and faced enormous prejudice and discrimination despite their sacrifice and heroism -- the same situation Miro faces in the story. Miro can't get justice or respect even though he fought for a government that is mistreating his people and family. So like any Western hero, he decides to take the law into his own hands, in a spectacular ending that is both thrilling in its unfolding and stylishly bold in its execution.\n\nImmersive and gripping, \"Miro\" takes the traditional war hero story and gives it an Indigenous slant, and then adds a Western kick to the drama. Yet instead of making a lone outsider the engine of the story's action, it puts Miro's domestic and ancestral identity at front and center, making him emotionally relatable as a husband and father out to preserve his culture and protect his loved ones from danger.\n\nIn many ways, the epic, even glamorous quality of the filmmaking is its own form of honor and wish fulfillment, for a people who have long suffered and whose struggles have been erased from historical record. The war experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island soldiers are only just beginning to be recovered and recorded, and while \"Miro\" isn't a documentary, it still inserts Indigenous presence in the great traditions of cinematic storytelling, with style, audacity and respect.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He goes into the match of marbles aiming to get back his prize, but he comes out with something much more than he anticipated.\n\nThis magical fantasy short film -- directed by Michael Swingler and co-written by Swingler and co-lead actor Carl Petersen -- is a richly imagined children's tale blending a Victoriana, almost steampunk sensibility with the emotional fears and concerns of young children that will nevertheless resonate with all ages.\n\nThere's a heightened feel to all the elements of craft, with the visuals and sound blending a Tim Burtonesque theatricality with attention to dusty, antique detail and a terrifically emotional score. This beautifully realized world is captured in burnished cinematography that adds to the \"out of time\" quality of the story.\n\nThe performances, too, have a theatrical quality fitting the nature of the material, though the film knows when to slow down enough to allow viewers to see decisions being made and feelings being processed. And as the villain, Petersen clearly relishes playing the role of a bad guy who relishes in his villainy, and there's a pleasingly arch touch of Malcolm McDowell to his performance.\n\nThe fantastical fable-like quality of the film could run away with itself, but happily it exists on a foundation of solid writing and storytelling, which never lets it get too flooded with flights of fancy for comprehension.\n\nThe narrative has the challenge of building a world and solidifying a good amount of background information (as well as delivering a good amount of dialogue in rhyme.) But despite the many elements it's balancing, it pays assiduous care to pacing and character, never overwhelming the young viewers the film is aimed towards. And by the time Jamison plays his final marble, it all comes together in a highly satisfying ending that makes all the craft and care invested into this short gem worth it.\n\nOscar-longlisted as a winner at the Dances With Films festival, \"All the Marbles\" offers viewers a journey into a wonderful, imaginative world so immersive that it's hard to believe the film is only 17 minutes long. Like many children's films, the ending is triumphant. But like the wisest of children's stories, it offers a smart, wise lesson in emotions and how to see the world.\n\nJamison learns that confronting your bully -- or your fears -- isn't about winning or losing. It's about questioning the nature of the game itself, the rules and very mentality of a bully trying to control and manipulate others with fear into a particular dynamic. By upending the dynamic, Jamison changes the stakes of the game for himself, refusing to play the role that the bully wants him to fall into -- and instead being the person he wants and chooses to be.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Like other noir classics, the dialogue is hard-edged and full of rhythm and style, the lighting is moody and expressionistic and the score and camerawork are excellent all around.\n\nOverall, \"Straight Down Low\" is a fresh, well-crafted pulse-pounding tale of crime and passion, just like the old-school classics it's inspired from.

By keeping up the appearance of power and influence, the money will flow once again, and he'll be back on top.\n\nThe perception of success comes at a cost, though. He lives in a luxury apartment that's unfurnished. His relationship with his ex-wife is tense. And he's not quite close to his young son. When he gets a weekend break with his young child, he discovers just how fragile the facade is.\n\n\"Top Floor\" is a quiet character piece that takes place in the world of high finance, captured in beautiful cinematography and skillful camerawork.\n\nThe glossy surfaces and sophisticated trappings mask a great hunger for connection and honesty, captured in subtle, sensitive performances by the entire cast. With  thoughtfulness and skill, the film examines just what it means to have success -- and what it really costs to attain.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She's also a monster in a world where humans and monsters co-exist, yet the sensitive and insecure soul struggles to fit in with either side. She's trying to find her footing, but assimilating into a world made for humans isn't working out too well for her.\n\nBut after a disastrous stand-up set, Martha meets Kevin, a monster who's proud of who he is and unafraid to reveal his horns -- and offers Martha a new way of accepting herself in a cold, hostile world.\n\nWriter-director Christopher Weekes's magical short drama is a wonderful work of empathy, which plays its premise and builds its world lightly in service of a heartwarming story about self-acceptance, kindness and compassion.\n\nSubtle and expressive visual effects work stands alongside muted, naturalistic cinematography and touches of comedy to evoke a world similar in feel to Spike Jonze's work. Like Jonze's films, this short has a similar visionary playfulness in its vision of the world and its evocation of humanity in all its awkwardness by endearingly odd, furry creatures. But \"Martha\" is more emotionally sincere and direct, with no ambivalence about evoking its titular character's emotional journey, from pain to fear to hope.\n\nMartha is voiced by actress Rose Byrne, whose soft-spoken, supple voice endows the character with plenty of charm, awkwardness and vulnerability. As a monster, she's endowed plenty of emotional range, which contrasts with the often bigoted humans she finds herself alongside, who shout \"Show us your horns!\" in leering voices when she's on stage.\n\nMonsters are considered an inferior species in Martha's world, and with rules that force them to stand on buses and prevents them from drinking alcohol, it's also a clear nod to past racist polices in the U.S. Yet these parallels are handled with a light touch, as is the world-building and combination of puppetry and visual effects that bring the monsters to life so convincingly, with beautifully modulated facial expressions and physical movements. It's this gentle yet confident hand that allows viewers to relax into Martha's world, which is so much like our own.\n\nAnd her own emotional trajectory will be recognizable to anyone who has ever felt uncomfortable in their skin or targeted for being different in any way. When she meets Kevin, so warmly and confidently voiced by Byrne's real-life partner Bobby Cannavale, she finds a space where her monster self is accepted, even celebrated. Though the date goes awry, she still discovers that what makes her different is also what makes her powerful.\n\nWhat makes \"Martha the Monster\" such a relatable, engaging story is how recognizable Martha's arc is. But it's also in how deep the story is willing to go into her pain and vulnerability that offers the rich reward of Martha's happy ending. Though the movie is about a monster, it's deeply and richly human in its emotion. And though it's a short, Martha will remain in viewers' memories as a fully realized character, full of wondrous, magical humanity.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He's a Brooklynite, a neighbor, a part of a local community. He's also a Sikh-American, one who feels a certain wariness descend upon and around him as news of a terrible hate crime clouds the upcoming Fourth of July celebrations.\n\nAs tensions rise, he faces pointed stares and looks -- some at his \"pagg,\" or turban -- on the subway. His work even pulls him from an important presentation. But when he faces a direct, ugly, emotionally brutal encounter on the street, he makes a decision that proves ultimately both tragic and futile.\n\nWriter-director Nardeep Khurmi -- who also plays the lead role of Mandeep -- has crafted a short drama that explores what it means to be an ethnic American in a politically and racially charged climate.\n\nThrough compelling, well-constructed writing and focused, intelligent performances, it uses film's ability to allow others to step into another's footsteps and understand what it's like to have one's existence constantly questioned and guarded against in the course of everyday life.\n\nThe script builds Mandeep's experience gradually, first as an internal horror and anxiety when he first hears of the hate crime on the media. Then, through adroit editing and direction, the camera captures the growing web of subtle yet cutting interactions he faces, whether it's in the way his fellow subway riders stare at his backpack or turban or the way they freeze when he enters a space. Though these actions are small, they have a deep impact on Mandeep.\n\nThe storytelling then slowly escalates the tension by taking those race-clouded judgments and assumptions and making them more intimate and personal upon Mandeep, especially when they begin to come from people he knows.\n\nNo one is consciously discriminating against the man they know, and they seem to be acting out of obliviousness or practicality -- but in his performance, Khurmi captures the sense of a man being slowly weighed down by a world who sees him first and foremost as his turban, and allows that to be the leading factor in how to see and treat him. When it finally builds up to an explosive, potentially violent encounter, Mandeep makes a difficult, heartbreaking decision.\n\n\"Pagg\" is well-crafted, smart and focused storytelling, delivering its narrative with clarity. Its aims for understanding and compassion are clear, especially with its emphasis on Mandeep's internal experience. Through this unwavering focus on the internal, the film captures the way subtle racism can erode away one's sense of freedom and self-determination in the world, seeping into our very being. The only way Mandeep can regain those very American virtues is to essentially make himself invisible -- but even the terrible price of self-negation isn't enough. No matter how he accommodates himself, the narrow, insular microscope he's under is always there, watching him with the mistrust, fear and anger that often come with unchecked assumptions.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Told with arch wit, a sharp ear for dialogue and terrific performances, it's man versus man battling for turf, but told with verve and finesse.\n\nThe story is anchored by a charismatic performance by lead actor Himesh Patel, who starred in the film \"Yesterday.\" This particular narrative uses his undeniable screen charisma, intelligence and charm to disarming ends.\n\nIn this battle of wit and strategy, each character's thinking process has to be conveyed with precision and subtlety with each beat -- a mental game of chess of sorts, complete with feints and smokescreens -- and Patel's performance delivers in spades. Actor Gideon Turner (who appeared on \"Eastenders\" with Patel) plays off him with his own sense of confidence, and watching the two men bring the excellent writing to life is a fascinating exercise in cleverness.\n\n\"The Fox\" moves with quicksilver rhythm, balancing moments of arch humor, moments of suspense and taut drama. Well-crafted and clever, it plays with expectations in a delightful way -- and is all about the pleasure of a well-played gambit that is as adroitly-executed and smart as the titular \"fox\" himself.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Faced with an unfamiliar environment and asked to contribute to an unusual task, Jack finds a way to be strong without anger -- and the key to working with his powers.\n\nWriter-director Chris Andrews's short drama has the look and feel of a naturalistic story, full of gritty social realism and a strong sense of observation. It's photographed with the muted color palette typical of many naturalistic films, and the direction and editing have a careful attention to small details of performance and visuals, whether it's the shift in a facial expression, a pause in conversation or the reveal of a tree within a forest.\n\nBut the \"superhero\" elements add an element of engagement and unexpected depth to this coming-of-age story. Obviously metaphorical, it's still handled with subtlety, thanks to the understated performances and excellent craftsmanship of the filmmaking itself.\n\nThere are no \"big\" moments or swelling orchestral scores to underline huge emotion or revelation. Instead, the film carefully lays out its emotional arc on the tiny but meticulous shifts in performance and visuals, reflecting the shift in Jack's confidence and competence. When Jack once again has to face confrontation, he has learned how to harness himself -- and discovers that his self-awareness actually makes him even more powerful than ever.\n\n\"Fire\" can technically be filed under the \"fantasy\" category. But while the special effects are minimal and quietly done, the supernatural elements of the story still accomplish what all great fantasy does: it takes those magical powers and realms to comment on the deepest, most mysterious inner aspects of human existence, and brings an element of the archetypal to a work of great psychological insight.\n\nAnger and rage at the injustices inflicted upon us are never easy to grapple with, and like Jack, we are all too often tempted to use those impulses towards violence. But those dark emotions have a role, as well as valuable information about our internal landscapes -- and by learning to deal with those feelings with a sense of self-mastery and insight, we can harness that righteousness towards productive ends, instead of against others or ourselves.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Life on the farm is beautiful in many ways, with a sense of natural beauty and the space to explore.\n\nBut the farm can also be a harsh place, where animals that didn't serve their purpose did not survive. Little Beth struggles feeling like a small part of a large family with no role to play. So when she comes across four duck eggs, she designates their caretaker, and shepherds them to hatching into little ducklings.\n\nBut despite her efforts, the ducks can't quite escape the farm's unsentimental ethos, and Beth soon understands the full import and weight of her self-appointed role.\n\nWriter/director Michael Killen -- along with co-writer Elisabeth Voltz, who adapted the script from her own book \"Shoebox Funeral\" -- unfurls its drama beautifully through gently poetic images and sensitively observed performances, creating a moving, meditative tale of innocence, wisdom and identity that is both simple and profound in feeling and execution.\n\nThe story is guided by a voiceover of an older Beth reflecting on this period in her childhood, as she tries to find her place in a large family, often lagging behind with no one seeming to wonder about her. Though there's clearly love and care in the group, she still often falls to the margins of such a large, busy family and can't help but draw parallels between herself and the small, weaker animals on the farm, and there's an ache and maturity in the voice and writing that sits in the liminal space between nostalgia and reflection.\n\nThe visuals, though, transmit young Beth's present-tense impressions, studying the world around her with wonderment and curiosity. Beautiful details of nature, a worn-in home and many, many animals fill the frame with loveliness and warmth, but the muted tones and colors keep the story from being too sentimental, adding instead an undertow of melancholy that suits this tale of deepening attunement with the realities of life. There's an omnipresence of low-level noise in the sound design as well, giving the sense of the contours of Beth's small yet rich world.\n\nThe spine of the film is young performer Maybrie Grace, who less plays a role than occupies a poetic space in the film's narrative with authenticity and vibrancy. She's wonderfully alive on screen, alert and responsive to the small details of the world around her. Her delight in discovering the eggs she later presides over is palpable, as is her devotion and attachment when the eggs become ducklings. She takes her role as carer for the weak and abandoned seriously, giving herself a purpose. But it also sets her up for heartbreak, when the inevitable happens and the fierce logic of nature takes its course.\n\n\"Shoebox\" is a small, delicate marvel of a short, a film about childhood that evokes not just the pastoral innocence of Beth's life but her own sense of self. Gentle, straightforward and humble in tone and execution, its seeming modesty belies an immense richness of feeling and depth as it traces one girl's beginning in the search for wisdom and meaning. With heart-rending clarity, it takes on no less than the confrontation of the realities of life and death -- and takes your breath away with its generous heart and grace.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She spends endless amounts of time and energy on Instagram, tracking her likes and followers as well as the pictures of others, which portray all the milestones she seems to lack: weddings, vacations, job success.\n\nBut as she sails into her party -- much of which is taken up with creating perfect pictures for Instagram -- she's concealing a deeper sorrow under the carefree smiles: she recently had an argument with her friend, an earth-shattering conversation that revealed just how toxic her self-absorption has become and just what her Instagram obsession is costing her.\n\nWriter-director David Mandell's short drama aims to be a generational statement from its title, but it gets its resonance by creating a well-observed, deeply empathetic character portrait of one beautiful, troubled girl and her relationship with social media.\n\nLike a Moebius strip, we see Becky's pains to be \"that girl\" on social media, as she preens for the camera and contorts herself to create just the right selfie for Instagram. We also see just how saturated her life and her social circle is with social media awareness, with talk of followers and likes. But we also see the insecurity and need for attention that drives her behavior.\n\nLike the glossy, glamorous most-liked pictures on Instagram, the film has the polished, sun-soaked look peculiar to films set in California, filled with a brightness and luminosity that seems to cover everything with a sheen of blithe, carefree prosperity.\n\nActress Isabel Pakzad does a terrific job balancing the essential divided selves of her role. She plays the persona of the popular, beautiful and successful social media \"It girl\" with aplomb, but when the story goes deeper, she also hints at Becky's despair and possible depression, flickering between hurt, self-awareness, self-loathing and vulnerability.\n\nWhen her friend Chelsea confronts her about her self-absorption in a well-balanced, emotionally complex scene that forms the emotional heart of the film, we understand exactly where Chelsea is coming from, but Pakzad also plays just enough of her character's core of emptiness and isolation that we can see it's not just a character flaw of selfishness, but something deeper and sadder at work. The realization drives her to the brink of the unthinkable, but then she gets a small reminder of what really matters -- enough to put on a smile and a happy face once again for the pictures.\n\n\"This Is 25\" begins with a breezy glossiness that resembles the persona of its central character, and functions also as a portrayal of what it means to come of age and into adulthood with an anonymous, distant yet all-powerful audience. It also asks questions of what role social media plays in mental health and possibly illness. As it proceeds, though, its storytelling goes underneath the pretty but brittle surface and into deeper, more resonant territory.\n\nWe may not all be social media stars, but there is enough exploration of the divide between public and private selves to reflect many people's experiences, not just the social media generation. Most of us have faces that we spackle on to cover our deep-seated insecurities and inadequacies, in order to get through life. But what happens when the mask we put on becomes the self? With the relentless documentation of today, the lines can become perilously blurred.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

In the high-stakes pressure of the encounter, revelations surface, fracturing the reality between them all and changing lives forever.\n\nWriter-director Michael Capone's short drama is a powerful, incisive snapshot of the moment that a family's understanding ruptures and explodes -- and the pernicious, poisonous secrets underneath the appearance of care and concern.\n\nThe short has a compressed narrative revolving around one tense confrontation, and it keeps its background information tightly controlled. And its creative approach is equally taut and economical, with focused, almost claustrophobic visuals, little background information in the writing, a minimal yet tense electronic score to develop its sense of unease.\n\nYet within its pared-down economy of elements, the film goes deep into a turning point in this family's life, using its deliberate and steady escalation of tension to squeeze out a dark secret -- and marking the moment that irrevocably changes the dynamic between all the members.\n\nThe excellent performances by the cast grant emotional specificity to each character, generating both understanding and suspense with careful and precise moments. Even the smallest blink has heavy portent, and once its secrets come out, we as viewers experience their poison and torment as much as the characters involved.\n\n\"Doorstep\" has a serious subject at its center, but at its core, it's about the violation of trust and love that is supposed to be at the heart of family, and how it obliterates the sense of security and personhood of those who were violated. The film has a strong, almost brilliant way to represent the way a person can feel invisible and dehumanized by what's happened to them: here, the victim is given only one shot -- a POV -- in the film. Like the rest of the short, the creative decision is brutally simple in its concept and execution -- but says multitudes about how abuse can erase its victims with silence, secrecy and shame.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He's quiet, often at the margin of events, drifting through the places and scenes of his sleepy small town in Texas.\n\nThough he doesn't say much, he grapples with his brother's death during a prank gone wrong -- and the role he played in it. Nobody else knows what happened, but it hangs on him heavily, giving him a sense of isolation until his world -- and his very self -- seem unrecognizable.\n\nWriter-director Nolan Wilson Goff's short drama takes its tone and feel from its main character. Through its minimal dialogue and its precise cinematography, the world of the film is contemplative, observational, even just a touch removed, as if we're drifting through this small slice of Texas, watching it shape and mold the characters within it. In its visual and narrative approach, it resembles the more experimental films of Gus Van Sant, another quintessentially American indie filmmaker whose work beautifully illuminates the condition of being an outsider within a community.\n\nVisually, the film feels like a series of photographs that the characters waft through, often choosing to show the action through a static wide shot or through long floating tracking shots. Ross is set adrift within these tableaux, often in the background or off to the side, as if barely tethered to the world. The terrible knowledge he bears -- and the guilt he has from the role he played in his brother's death -- also isolates him emotionally, just as he's visually isolated in the film.\n\nLead actor Tommy O'Brien -- from Netflix's \"Unbelievable\" -- offers an evocative performance, able to convey the weight of a terrible secret and guilt that is pushed well below the surface of everyday behavior, though it bubbles up at unexpected moments.\n\n\"Nobody Knows\" ultimately feels like a meditation on grief, guilt and how carrying those heavy burdens can make us feel peripheral and alone, even when surrounded by places and people who we know intimately. The film's beautifully fragile final scene, however, punctures the distance and remove, allowing the suppressed emotion to quietly float to the surface, in all its pain and tenderness.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But Libby is coming home from her unfulfilling job, and their conversation is tense and unproductive. But when Jess finds something unexpected in Libby's bag, it causes an argument that will upend the foundations for their relationship.\n\nWriter-director Courtney Therond's short two-hander drama is essentially a long conversation, but for Libby and Jess, it is an important, earth-shattering one, where long submerged truths and needs come to surface and leaves ripples that may affect the relationship in the future.\n\nConfined to one-bedroom, the narrative scope of the film feels at first stuffy and almost claustrophobic, mirroring the emotional reality of its characters. At first, it seems the couple is arguing about their asymmetrical desires and Libby's lack of direction in life, but then the fight quickly becomes about something much more.\n\nThe writing handles the emotional arc with exceptional sensitivity and compassion. It understands with great insight that long-term couples are rarely about the surface conflict, but about the unspoken, uncomfortable truths that we leave unsaid for the sake of peace or another person's feelings.\n\nWhat shines in the film are the performances by Jessica Mendez Siqueiros and Dana Aliya Levinson, who play Libby and Jess, respectively, with aching emotional honesty and a palpable sense of connection. They bring the film's superb dialogue to life, charting with precision the layers of resentment, unspoken pain and other difficult emotions that overlay an unspoken truth. But during this difficult conversation, they slowly unpeel to get to the raw, vulnerable truth.\n\nLibby has been with Jess through every step of her recent gender transition. But Libby has also had to push aside many of her own needs through this process over the years. However, she's at a point where she feels as if she's disappearing from her own life, and needs to find her way back to herself. It's a truth that is difficult to say, and equally difficult for Jess to hear -- and it's one that may change the course of not just their relationship, but their lives.\n\n\"The Dress You Have On\" is an important film about one aspect of a transgender experience, one that features a transgender actor and covers the emotional aftereffects of one specific transition. By being so courageous and honest within its specificity -- and by embracing human complexities about regret and desire in a way that almost anyone can recognize -- the film achieves a powerful, universal emotional resonance, leaving viewers with a bittersweet tenderness that breaks the heart open.\n\nUltimately, it's a story about the need for any human to be seen, heard and witnessed as fully themselves -- and for that need to be met by a partner, no matter what side they're standing on. In the end, the couple must hear one another -- not through their pre-existing filters, but by truly listening to the other as they are. Only then can they move forward, and whether or not it's together or apart, it will be with greater love and understanding.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He takes out a cake and a candle and sings \"Happy Birthday\" while holding back tears. Flashbacks of his son being born run through his mind.\n\nLater that night, Ramon drinks his sorrows away. He passes out on the sofa as Fox News talks about Trump's promise to build a border wall amid the presidential campaign race. A phone call wakes Ramon up. It's Captain Garza. They're short on officers tonight and needs him for the night shift. Ramon says he'll be there.\n\nAs Ramon changes into his uniform the locker room, Garza tells him he'll have a new partner, Garrett, tonight. They begin their patrol. Garrett talks about the weather and how he's from Chicago and just got to El Paso four months ago. They see a little girl cross the street in a costume -- it's the \"Day of the Dead,\" a Mexican holiday to celebrate those who have to part to the other side. Ramon tells Garrett he doesn't celebrate it -- there's nothing to celebrate.\n\nGarrett tells Ramon about a bust earlier this afternoon. Officers came across some illegals and one of them was carrying a weapon. Gunfire broke out and a 12-year-old girl died. Ramon asks if the officer was okay. When Garrett repeats that a little girl was killed, Ramon tells him she was on the \"wrong side of the line.\" Then, he reminds him if he's being fired at, his duty as an officer is to protect his life and his unit -- it doesn't matter if his target is 50- or 12-years-old. He's supposed to return fire and shoot to kill.\n\nGarrett just thinks some things could have been avoided. Ramon asks if he's ever fired at anybody before. Garrett admits he hasn't.\n\nSuddenly, Ramon sees something moving up ahead. They pull over and Ramon runs out tells them to get down. Then, he sees a woman run and begins to pursue on foot. He tells Garrett to call backup. As he tackles her, they roll down a hill. He gets up and realizes she's pregnant and trauma from the fall has induced her to go into labor.\n\nHe is forced to deliver the baby.\n\nThe woman asks if Ramon has children, and he tells her he has a son. She tells him to treat her baby as if it was his son. As he tells her to breathe and push, he gets flashbacks of the birth of his own son. He successfully delivers her baby boy and collapses to the ground.\n\nWhen he wakes up the next morning, the woman has a gun pointed to his head. She says Ramon saved her life and her baby and spares his life. She tells him not to come after them and he nods. Then, she thanks him and walks backwards slowly.\n\nSuddenly, Garrett shoots and she drops dead to the ground. Ramon runs over and picks up the baby to comfort him.\n\nBack in the locker room, Garza tells him the situation is very black and white. An illegal attacked him, took his weapon and intended to use it against him. Garrett arrived, found him on the ground covered in blood and returned fire. Garza says Garrett was doing his job.\n\nRamon asks what about the baby. Garza says the he was born on U.S. soil so he's a citizen, then reminds him that Garrett saved his life.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Chris is an elderly man who suffers from Alzheimer's, and he's desperately trying to hold onto his slowly shattering mind.\n\nHis son Michael comes in to check up on his dad periodically, but as Chris's mind flutters between past and present, the line between the two begin to blur in ways both beautiful and painful.\n\nA gentle, evocative film suffused with melancholy, this short drama -- which won a director's prize at Cannes -- is gorgeously shot. The stunning images capture with precision the nature of memory loss and deterioration as the camera drifts through Chris's memories.\n\nPatient, dreamlike, sensitive and a touch surreal, \"Where Do Lilacs Come From\" evokes the tragedy of Alzheimer's with a gentle respect, and its sense of poetry and beauty get at the heart of love, memory, family and loss in a way that will linger with you, long after the film ends.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They plan to hit up clubs and bars, but there's only one hitch: only one of them is actually 21.\n\nStill, they have fake IDs and a plan to sweet-talk the bouncer at the club. But their plan to have a good time proves harder to execute than they thought -- thanks to a subtle but brilliantly unexpected flip in this thoughtful, intellectually provocative drama.\n\nDirector Joosje Duk's acclaimed short drama starts with a daring, subversive script that upends notions of hot-button issues like racism, sexism and privilege in a playful yet powerful way.  The film is further carried by smart, skilled performances and equally well-crafted direction. There's obvious intelligence behind the story, but \"Night\" manages to connect its big ideas to the everyday experiences of friendship, exploring what happens when people aren't open, honest or accepting of one another.\n\nIt all comes together in a short but powerful cinematic experience that truly explores a story's ability to let the audience walk in another person's shoes and move towards compassion and understanding.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She says she's back to start a new job at the children's hospital after working with children at a refugee camp.\n\nThe officers are suspicious. Meanwhile, her boyfriend Aaron waits for her arrival outside.\n\nAnna sits patiently, watching as the officers handle each immigrant in a condescending tone.\n\nWhen her name is called, they grill her in the same manner. She calmly answers each question, unfazed.\n\nWith each passing minute, though, Aaron grows increasingly worried. He has bought flowers, hired a driver and an quartet to propose on the day of their 4-year anniversary. But Anna hasn't arrived and isn't picking up her phone.\n\nThe officers catch Anna on a technicality -- she started work for an American company in Uganda a few days before her visa took effect.\n\nShe explains the company had mistakenly told her that working overseas wouldn't affect her immigration, but the officers are unforgiving.\n\nEven when Anna offers help an old Czech woman, the officers remain cold, following the letter of the law.\n\nAaron, meanwhile, grows frustrated. The driver and quartet leave, despite his efforts to pay them for their time. With his proposal plans in ruins, he runs into the airport searching for Anna.\n\nMeanwhile, the officers tell Anna she won't be allowed in the country, stating that she had worked and stayed illegally in the past. She pleads her case, saying she's been a resident for eight years, her hospital will sponsor her visa and she's spent $300,000 on education. But the officer refuses to budge -- even when she asks for a lawyer.\n\nHe tells she doesn't have any rights at immigration checkpoints and she'll be sent back to the Czech Republic to sort out her immigration issue.\n\nAnna keeps pushing until she's told she won't likely be able to return for five years.\n\nAs the devastation sets in, she calls Aaron. But before she can tell him she's being sent back, he asks her to marry him.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But when she finds a gun among her dad's belongings, movies and real life start to blur in possibly dangerous ways.\n\nDirecting team Paul Holbrook and Samuel Dawe's tense drama combines \"kitchen sink\" gritty realist British drama with the almost theatrical tensions and silence of the classic Western genre.\n\nThe combination of the styles is fascinating, but serves both the story and the main character, who develops a vivid imaginative life to find relief from the depressing financial and emotional poverty of her real life.\n\nThe story takes time to set up the unnamed girl's circumstances, but once the storytelling kicks in, it powers forward, ratcheting up the tension to an almost unbearable point. The short is anchored by a strong main performance by the young lead Matilda Randall, who seethes and suffers, often in silence. She never \"indicates\" emotion, beautifully underplaying the dark undertows of her grief, sadness and anger.  And when they finally bubble up to the surface in the final gripping confrontation, her actions and decisions are soul-crushing, both for her and the audience.\n\n\"A Girl And Her Gun\" juggles both an audacious aesthetic experiment and heart-wrenching social commentary, posing fascinating questions about the enduring pull of violence and its intersection with social disenfranchisement. The craftsmanship of the film is impeccable, with taut camerawork and excellent acting, but ultimately the main impact of the story is emotional and visceral -- and memorable for its devastation.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Murphy tells a small town story about love, loss and a deep desire for something different.\n\nAs the characters and the town intersect with these themes -- sometimes beautifully, sometimes violently -- we come to realise that hope can stem from even the most tragic circumstances.\n\nAt 22, Kieran is the embodiment of drifting complacency. Living at home with his emotionally-fractured father, wiling away his days working at the local supermarket and lacking any ambition for a future outside of his home town.\n\nKieran's one escape is long-term girlfriend Tilly. She's a dreamer. Smart, sensitive, ambitious yet fragile. She can light a room at the drop of a hat -- but her desire to leave, to grow, to change, is gnawing at her. When she is offered the opportunity to take up a future interstate, her insecurities take hold.\n\nWhen tragedy strikes this small coastal town, those effected must decide to either pick up the pieces and confront there own misgivings or allow the cycle to continue.\n\n\"'Pillars' is a story for now. It shines a light on a subject that is still fighting for the national spot light. It examines a human reaction to loss and tragedy in a stagnate and complacent environment,\" Murphy said. \"In order to convey these themes, I relied heavily on the abilities of our cast. Creating strong back stories and encouraging the actors to improvise around the text, was key to making the action and interactions between characters organic.\n\nVimeo: http://vimeo.com/user13058937\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/patchadamsproductions\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4624782/\nWebsite: http://www.patchadamsproductions.com\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Sometimes, the questions are asked from the point of view of the bodyguard, as if he's asking it himself-- other times from a narrative distance, completely removed from the events to come.\n\nThe strings of questions begin with the mundane -- a burnt yellow Yves St. Laurent shirt and dull gray Citroen -- and delve into his daily routine of alertness and caution.\n\nEach question increases the escalates the events, with an occasional sentences serving as the meat of the story and a pause in the tension. For example:\n\n\"In every part of the country, in large cities and small towns, bottles of champagne have been iced, put away, reserved for a celebration, reserved for a special day. Is the bodyguard aware of this?\"\n\nThe bodyguard is protecting a dictator, but all around, citizens are preparing for a large celebration, foreshadowing the coming events. The questions reveal nothing about his fears or anxieties. All we know is that the special day won't go well for him.\n\nAs the story unfolds, we get a glimpse into the bodyguard's thoughts:\n\n\"Seated in a restaurant with his principal, the bodyguard is served, involuntarily, turtle soup. Does he recoil, as the other eats? Why is this near-skeleton, his principal, of such importance to the world that he deserves six body-guards, two to a shift with the shifts changing every eight hours, six bodyguards of the first competence plus supplementals on occasion, two armored cars, stun grenades ready to hand under the front seat? What has he meant to the world? What are his plans?\"\n\nWhy doesn't he like turtle soup? Perhaps a sign of the gap in their social class, causing the bodyguard to question the value of the dictator's worth.\n\nThe story comes to a head with in the car.\n\n\"In the Mercedes, the bodyguard and his colleague stare at the hundreds, men and women, young and old, who move around the Mercedes, stopped for a light, as if it were a rock in a river. In the rear seat, the patron is speaking into a telephone. He looks up, puts down the telephone. The people pressing around the car cannot be counted, there are too many of them; they cannot be known, there are too many of them; they cannot be predicted, they have volition. Then, an opening. The car accelerates.\n\nIs it the case that, on a certain morning, the garbage cans of the entire city, the garbage cans of the entire country, are overflowing with empty champagne bottles? Which bodyguard is at fault?\"\n\nWe learn the dictator is dead, and the country has had its night of celebration. Our bodyguard failed to prevent the assassination. But who's at fault -- the bodyguard or the dictator?\n\nMaybe neither.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Then she sees something truly unsettling: the man shoves her hard enough to knock her out cold. Becca and the man make eye contact as he realizes what he's done, but before he can say or do anything to her, she runs away, scared for her own safety.\n\nTime passes and she's lulled back into a sense of safety, trying to put the memory behind her. Until one evening, when she meets the man out one night at a bar -- and he insists on walking along the way with her at the end of the night.\n\nWriter-director Clare Cooney -- who also plays the lead role of Becca -- has crafted a quiet, intelligent urban thriller that explores the issues of silence, intervention and why some cannot speak up even in the face of violence. With precise, intelligent performances and equally smart, complicated writing, the short is a study in power, threat and the subtle yet insidious ways these are asserted -- and how it chokes off a sense of agency from those subjected to it.\n\nFrom the film's beautiful opening scene, the story captures how the simple experience of making one's way through the world, energetic and carefree on a beautiful day, can change with just a small, unsettling sense of threat. The camerawork and cinematography begin with a sense of optimism and radiance, capturing an independent, free modern woman in the fullness of her life.\n\nBut that sense of possibility begins to constrict once Becca stumbles upon the couple. While the argument between the man and woman is clearly volatile -- and their dynamic seemingly abusive -- the killing that results is accidental, and the man is upset, stunned and shocked. But when he spots Becca, the sense of threat he emanates is transferred to her, and alone and afraid for her safety, she runs away and later stays silent, traumatized by what she's seen and scared he might know where she lives. What works in these scenes is how quiet, powerful and yet ultimately underplayed they are, avoiding melodrama and haunting the rest of the film with a sense of fear and threat.\n\nThat sense of constant but latent potential violence informs Becca's actions and emotions throughout the film and play out in a subtle way. Trauma, guilt and fear gradually mold and constrict her world, and her own sense of efficacy within it, and the film itself gets darker in tone and visuals. The writing slowly lays out Becca's internal emotional journey, which proceeds in an unexpected way. There are beats of disconnection, and maybe even denial, and lulls where the anonymity of modern urban life seems to offer an illusion of safety.\n\nBut that illusion is shattered when the man pops up some weeks later at a local trivia night. Proximity means possible peril, and the film shifts into a highly effective thriller, skillfully building up to a tense and suspenseful climax and confrontation that is largely constructed through what remains unspoken but lurking constantly under the surface.\n\nThe man's final scene alone with Becca makes clear he is not afraid to wield power and assert control and dominance in the situation. In the end, he asks Becca, \"Are we good?\" It sounds like a question, but it feels like a threat. It's a quiet but explosive moment.\n\nMany will likely see Becca's dilemma through a moral or ethical lens. Did she do the wrong thing in staying quiet? Why didn't she just speak up? But arguments of ethics often hinge on assumptions that everyone is an equally free and equal agent in their life. What works about \"Runner\" and its powerful ending is how it shows that this often isn't the case. Power and the threat of violence are often subtly wielded, but the silence and complicity it can coerce -- even in the interest of self-preservation -- are nevertheless deafening and deadening.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But Leonard himself has a fall, and he soon realizes the limits of their situation and his ability to remain his wife's caretaker.\n\nWriter-director Eric Shahinian, along with co-writer Maya Huang, is a portrait of devotion, marriage and the devastating realities of a disease that has striken an estimated 5.7 million Americans in 2018, according to the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nThe story's scope is pared down, taking place in one setting and a limited timeframe. But it captures a key turning point for one husband, who must rethink what it means to stay with someone \"in sickness and in health.\"\n\nThe construction of the narrative is solid, with each beat building on each other and raising both character development and dramatic tension. The camerawork is warm in tone, capturing the sense of domesticity and home that Leonard and Elsie live and want to stay together within.\n\nBut ultimately the strength of the short rests of its intimate, warmly human performances, particularly by Chiz Schultz and Eileen Miller, who play the couple at the film's center. Through the acting, they capture the dance of love, frustration and ultimately fear that arises when Leonard discovers he may not able to be there all the time, in the way that Elsie needs.\n\n\"Head Above Water\" is a quietly heartbreaking film that turns its lens on the toll that caretaking can have upon those who devote their time and lives to caring for those with Alzheimer's, which can be frustrating and anxious. Beautifully made and ultimately moving, the film ultimately honors the everyday heroism of caretakers, even as it illustrates one man's realization of its limits.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He launches into his own investigation, and comes across a \"club\" where kids climb into tumble dryers at a 24-hour laundromat and see how long they can last -- a phenomenon that eventually goes viral and becomes potentially perilous.\n\nDirector Simon Dymond's thrilling short is a playful riff on David Fincher's \"Fight Club,\" which lends the story a tense and compelling pace. With sharp camerawork, a propulsive score and clever performances, the film is continually engaging and suspenseful.\n\nThe short is also based on scriptwriter Russ Sutherland's true story, who discovered the illicit underground wash club in his days at university -- and in his efforts to expose it, became its unwitting leaders. Dymond reached out to Sutherland after hearing his story on a podcast and realizing the spoken-word piece would translate well to the screen.\n\nIn a world where \"ice bucket challenges\" and \"planking\" quickly spread over social media, \"Wash Club\" explores what happens when a story spins out of control the farther and faster they spread. It's also a pure cinematic pleasure, and a compact yet powerful entertainment that will leave viewers wanting more.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

To him, he's in a movie of his own making, as an up and coming musician who needs only this amp for musical glory.\n\nThe film derives its edge and humor through the collision of these two different \"movies.\" Through witty, funny but emotionally honest writing and a set of deft performances that navigate both the comedic and dramatic demands of the material, the dissolving couple try to handle their interruption with grace, momentarily suppressing their raw feelings and the reality of what's going on in the presence of an outsider.\n\nBut the amp buyer simply doesn't wise up to what's happening in front of him, slowly raising the tension for Mitch and Emma, who just want to move on with their difficult conversation. Ryan never gets a clue, which leads to an impassioned outburst from Emma, which becomes the film's centerpiece monologue about love, loss and acceptance. It's a moving, powerhouse moment, full of emotion and honesty, and it's wonderfully juxtaposed with cutaways to the clueless looks from Ryan, wondering what's really going on in front of him.\n\n\"Damage\" is small-scale in its narrative scale -- just three people in a room having a conversation -- but it unfurls a huge amount of awkward but very real pathos and humor from its story, writing and performances. Relatable and well-executed, the short is both a well-earned laugh at life's absurdity and a love letter of gratitude and pain to past relationships. It also offers a small reminder that everyone is dealing with something in life, even right in front of us -- we only need to truly open our eyes to see it, in all its real, weird, awkward authenticity.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

When he's there waiting in the doorway, a car careens down the street, but Joel thinks nothing of it.\n\nBut when he leads his girlfriend from the shop to their car, they hear a sound that could be a gunshot. Unsure of what he's heard, Joel sets off to investigate the sound... and walks right into a nightmare.\n\nWriter and director Antonio Ore\u00f1a-Barlin's short drama is a tour-de-force of filmmaking, portraying its intense emotional situation over the course of an impressive 12-minute uninterrupted take.\n\nLike other \"oners,\" the single coordinated flow of action immerses the viewer in a particularly visceral way into the situation, highlighting the superb craft and powerful acting. We discover what the main character learns as he pieces together what's happened, and we share in the immediacy and anguish of his experience.\n\n\"Suburbia\" was based on Ore\u00f1a-Barlin's real-life experience, and has won several awards during its festival run. While its sense of craft is undeniably excellent, it serves a gut-wrenching story that will break your heart by the film's conclusion.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He struggles in the wake of his mother's death. He also is bullied by his sister, who subjects him to twisted games of surprisingly menace.\n\nHe struggles with the emptiness, tension and cruelty of his world, often taking refuge in the woods near his home and nursing the memories of his deceased mother. But after one game too many, eventually Jack asserts himself against his sister, leveling the same coiled threat against her that was used against him.\n\nWriter-director Joy Webster's taut, suspenseful family drama traces the arc of an isolated, troubled young boy, as he attempts to grapple with his grief and find a sense of control and power in his often lonely world.\n\nThe pared-down shooting style and dialogue emphasizes the paucity of guidance, warmth and nurturing in this family, emphasizing the emptiness and neglect of the world around Jack. But despite the seeming minimalism of the craft, the almost offhand, unobtrusive visual approach is actually quite meticulous, especially in capturing the undercurrents of emotions in the young boy.\n\nThe one adult figure of the narrative is often rendered as a visually marginal element, with his head cropped out of frame or a mere figure filling in a wider shot. Yet the absent dad's presence speaks volumes, especially since he takes his daughter shooting, and she learns to associate guns with pleasure, power, dominance and control -- and finds ways to play with them when she and Jack are left on their own.\n\nWith such an intimate focus on the experience of the brother and sister, the performances of the young actors at the center become key. Both actor Jack Fulton as the oppressed little brother and actress Ava Preston as the often malevolent sister offer subtle yet explosive performances of remarkable and affecting precision.\n\nLike the filmmaking itself, their characterizations are on the understated side, but both are allowed moments of dimensionality, where viewers can glimpse the resentment seething in Jack, especially when he is pushed by his sister's bullying to retaliate in a dark, foreboding way. Her own vulnerable, fearful reaction to the turning of the tables emphasizes that she's not just an antagonist -- she, too, is also just a child in this background of sadness and neglect, making the tragedy of this family all the more achingly devastating.\n\n\"Game\" is a finely honed and crafted drama, whose quietness in tone, approach and performance belies its powerful impact. Through an almost forensic sense of emotional intelligence and an intimate, compassionate focus on character and feeling, it offers keen insight into how the roots of violence plant themselves in emotionally barren or psychologically toxic families and individuals -- and how they take hold and explode in ways that are distressing, and portend darkly for the future.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Meanwhile, Pat is helping her choose what to dress to wear. When he asks what outfit is for, they ignore him. He asks his mom to take her pills, but she pushes them away, asking him to pick a dress. Frustrated, he tells Pat to go upstairs.\n\nWe realize everyone is here to spend time with Mary amid the last days of her life. Aaron is clearly unhappy with her resignation. Mary tries to comfort Aaron and tells him everything will be all right. Pat pops in with another dress and Aaron storms out and into the comforts of the barn.\n\nHe accidentally cuts his hand trying to feed his dog. So he walks back into the house to treat the wound. In dining room, his uncles joke about the time bullies locked his bike around his neck. When Aaron tells them his mom took it off of him, they suggest he should have taught him to stand up for himself. Aaron won't let Pat treat his hand and goes to his mom instead.\n\nAs Mary applies a bandage, she begins to vomit. Aaron doesn't know what to do. Pat hurriedly tells him to get a cloth and a pan, but he keeps asking his mom what she needs. Pat tells him to get out. Upset, Aaron goes back to the barn. His dog runs up, wanting to play, but he isn't in the mood. He tells him no, but the dog persists. Overwhelmed, he kicks him away.\n\nThe family gathers around Mary in the bedroom and reminisce about the past. Aaron again asks if she wants to take her medication, and everyone ignores him. When his uncle Richard asks who's going to inherit the farm, Aaron yells at him and tells him it's none of his business.\n\nAaron storms out and Richard follows, telling him that his wife had died a similar death -- except she had suffered until the end. Richard continues to tell Aaron that he's immature and needs to grow up -- instead of comforting his mom in her painful last days, he wants her to hold his hand.\n\nLater that evening, Aaron and his mom have a moment alone. She asks him to promise he'll go to the hospital with her. He reluctantly nods and gives her a hug. Aaron walks through the house and notices each family member struggling to cope with Mary's last days in their own private way. He goes back to the barn and plays with his dog.\n\nThey tell him they're ready.\n\nEverybody gathers around Mary and a glass of Nembutal, a barbiturate that's completely painless, is placed in front of her. After they say a prayer, Aaron asks everyone to leave so he can be alone with his mom. Then, he grabs his mom's hand and tells her he knows what to do. He gives her one last hug and picks up the glass and hands it to her. As she drinks it, he tells her to breathe. She calms down and quietly dies in his loving embrace.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She wants him to meet her family, and he's spooked by her request.\n\nBut when Arthur gets into an accident, he calls 411 for help from a dilapidated phone booth and talks to a frighteningly omniscient service on the other line.\n\nThis iteration of 411 knows everything about Arthur, from his current romantic situation to his high school memories. And it has surprising insight into Arthur's current condition, giving him information -- and help -- in an unexpected way.\n\nWriter-director Oliver Power, along with co-writer Rick Rosenberg -- has created a short drama that begins with the dark ominous sheen and suspenseful buildup of a thriller, but it reveals itself to be a surprising drama of sly emotional intelligence and subtle humor.\n\nThe narrative toggles between Arthur's recent evening with Laurel and his drive and accident. His scene with Laurel has a nice, easy rapport and affection, but actor Geoffrey Cantor also details Arthur's underlying fear of commitment. He's able to encapsulate a man who fears taking the next step, bringing a kind of remoteness to the characterization that hints at his aversion, but also his loneliness.\n\nSometimes juggling past and present in a short film can prove disorienting in a short running time, but the back-and-forth here builds suspense -- along with the beautifully moody night-time cinematography and isolated visual compositions. It also creates some storytelling sleight-of-hand. Will Arthur meet a dark end and come to regret his last words with Laurel? It certainly may seem so.\n\nBut then the film takes a turn into magical realism, as the voice of 411 enters into the story. 411 isn't just a recording, but a full-on character, brought to life by the superb F. Murray Abraham. Thanks to the Oscar winner's mercurial talents (and excellent dialogue), 411 is both all-knowing, sarcastic, wise, darkly teasing and ominous -- somewhere between an older father figure, a mysterious supernatural entity and God.\n\nWith 411's help, Arthur begins to put together the former disconnected parts of himself, unearthing the source of his great pain and ambivalence. Over the course of this one fateful night, he finally owns up to his desires and summons up the courage to take a risk in life. Arthur's ending ultimately makes \"411\" not just a beautifully crafted piece of genre filmmaking, but a parable for emotional growth: examining the past, connecting it to the present and being brave enough to move forward into an uncertain future.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He's just found out that his daughter has been abused, and he's looking to retaliate against her boyfriend.\n\nTearing out of his driveway, he speeds through their middle-class Southern town to confront the abuser. But the confrontation takes a turn in a way that he doesn't expect -- one that reveals his helplessness as a parent and the limits of violence and domination.\n\nWriter-director Bobb Barito's pared-down, tense drama begins with an explosive fit of emotion, with the father raring with a primal vengeance in the name of his daughter's violation. Right away, the film feels like it's dropped the audience right into a climax, complete with high emotion and rapid-fire visuals to match. Taking its cues from the main character, the camerawork and editing are equally volatile and agitated, building momentum towards what seems like an inevitably heroic confrontation.\n\nBut the storytelling makes an interesting decision to play out the confrontation between father and his daughter's attacker in an unexpected way -- one that reveals the ethos of aggression and violent retribution that pervades the community. Miles does get the justice he desires and his abuser does pay for what he has done, but not in the way that's expected.\n\nActor Ed Moran deftly captures the way Miles deflates in the wake of the incident, where he's rendered strangely ineffectual and helpless despite everything. That sense of impotence is carried over into the film's quieter yet more emotionally devastating second half, where Miles discovers that no amount of vengeance or \"justice\" equips him to be there the way his daughter needs the most. He clearly loves his daughter, and flies easily into a rage when she's harmed. But she needs comfort, care and solace, and Miles is sadly unequipped to offer those to her.\n\nThe last scene's sense of silence and shadowy stillness speak eloquently of his daughter's heartbreaking isolation, their broken relationship and Miles's own shortcomings as a father. Miles has done what any \"good\" father would do, and yet the film is both compassionate and unflinching in portraying the limitations of that role's ultimately narrow conception.\n\n\"Light My Fire\" is focused, lean and pared down in its writing and narrative scope. But by subtly inverting the traditional structure of a short film and showing the denouement of what's usually a cathartic climax, it offers intelligent, subtle commentary on just what this catharsis of retribution, revenge and \"justice\" achieves. This deeply entrenched imperative of patriarchy and masculinity, the film suggests, doesn't serve the people it supposedly protects.\n\nInstead, it's more about the exertion of power: a game of winners and losers who are destined never to come out on top, no matter how fierce their rage and anger may be. And those who are collateral damage under that game are on their own with their pain, just when love and care are needed most.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He asks how long the HIV test will take -- 15 minutes. He's tense.\n\nAs he takes his seat in the waiting area, he asks the man next to him for a cigarette. The man doesn't smoke. So Jude walks across the parking lot to the convenience store for a pack of reds and a lighter.\n\nHe smokes to take his mind off the situation.\n\nHis phone rings.

His phone rings again. It's a little girl. He says he's coming, he's just grabbing some things at the store. Then, he asks if she's finished her homework.\n\nIt's her birthday tomorrow. He tells her he'll pick her up from school tomorrow and take her to mini-golf.\n\nWhen she asks if dad can come, Jude begrudgingly says if he wants to. She goes and asks, but dad says he's not sure if he can go.\n\nAs Jude leaves, he sees a police officer giving him a ticket for parking in a handicap spot. He explains he's had a hard day and just wasn't thinking. But she gives him the ticket regardless.\n\nHe sits back in the waiting room.

Surrounded by pot and a crowd of carefree spirits, Steve runs into an old friend and joins in on the celebration around him. But the highs only cause him to question himself, miss his family and confront his own feelings of failure and sadness around his divorce.\n\nDirectors Irene Chin and Kurt Vincent, along with writer Adam Callahan, have crafted a warmly observant dramedy that serves as a slice-of-life vignette of countercultural life in San Francisco, a character portrait of a man grappling with feelings of sadness and inadequacy after divorce and a tender, radiant portrait of the bond between a child and her father.\n\nFilmed during an actual 4/20 celebration in San Francisco, the visuals and camerawork by cinematographer Tyler McPherron have a loose, improvised, even jazz-like feel, letting the eye wander and meander in the same way that Steven does. The looseness eschews tight control in favor of letting viewers drift as the scenes play out, capturing the sights and sounds of the celebration in the park in the process. Compared to contemporary depictions of San Francisco as a slick locus of technology and wealth, the shambolic revelry serves as both a nostalgic reminder of San Francisco's hippie roots and a time capsule of a beloved event in a rapidly transforming city. Like San Francisco itself, the film is shaped with an amiable, relaxed sense of wandering and ease, complete with an undertow of melancholy and punctuated by percussive jazz-like riffs and reggae music.\n\nBut the film never loses sight of Steve, who allows himself to be carried with the currents of celebration. Coming off an awkward, petty handing-off with his ex-wife, it's easy to see just why Steven is discombobulated, and why he'd take advantage of his freedom to drift into the cavorting and carousing around him -- something he'd likely not be able to do if he had his daughter with him. Yet he can't quite let himself relax into the scene: his muted yet palpable ache for his daughter remains with him, even through the evils of thick smoke.\n\nActor Steve Talley, along with his daughter California Summer, captures beautifully the pleasures and quiet joys of parenthood in his performance, whether it's in the pleasure of sharing pictures of his child with others or the gentle, engaged way he speaks and listens with Cali. It's a portrayal that deftly captures how a parent's thoughts are never far from their children, even when the kids are somewhere else. And the divide leads to a palpable ache for Steve, even surrounded by fun and camaraderie.\n\nBut then he's reminded that, though that ache will never go away, he can embrace the present moment -- the only thing that anyone truly has. Steve's afternoon then becomes a small, delicate turning point, one that imbues \"How It's Goin'\" with poignancy, warmth and a Zen-like sense of equanimity. Though Steve will never stop missing his daughter -- and though the reality of divorce is messy and difficult -- he can accept where he is, and allow himself and others a small measure of grace in the space that it opens up.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The crowds are screaming, and the promoter is anxious to get the bout going.\n\nBut in the back rooms, he faces a bigger ordeal: should he even be allowed to fight at all? As his trainer father and his concerned sister fight it out, the fighter faces a difficult choice.\n\nThis short sports drama boasts stunning photography and editing, creating a visceral cinematic experience that immerses viewers in the fighter's experience in and out of the ring.\n\nBeyond the camerawork, the film is rooted in strong performances, particularly from lead actor Tommy Jessop, who was the first actor with Down syndrome to star in a BBC prime-time drama. To prepare for the role, Tommy and actor Simon Kunz, who played his father, trained at a famed boxing club in East London, giving the film a remarkable authenticity and power.\n\n\"Fighter\" is careful not to take sides, and both arguments pulling at Tommy are presented with honesty and passion. But the ambiguity at the film's end -- and the idea that those with disabilities also deserve the right to self-determination -- gives the film an unforgettable impact that lingers long after the movie ends.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Meanwhile, his up-and-coming mechanic Skip is \"killing it\" in the micro circuit.\n\nOne day, a mysterious sponsor gives Davy an bizarre proposition -- he enjoys seeing the sport's potential for carnage and wants Davy to crash during the race. In return, he'll buy him a new car, as he wants it.\n\nThe next day, Davy walks into the chicken farm and asks his boss Walter for an advance on his paycheck. Walter likes Davy, but thinks he's wasting his life at the track. So he gives Davy a deal: if he commits to putting in more time at the farm, he'll pay him more.\n\nAs Davy and Skip make adjustments in the garage, Skip asks him if he can race on the big block on Saturday. Davy bluntly says no. But Skip keeps pushing, reminding him of a promise he made.\n\nLater, Davy meets the mysterious sponsor again, who emphasizes that he wants to see his car \"reduced to a state of ruin.\" No fender-benders. As race day approaches, Davy ponders his options.\n\nSaturday arrives. As Skip does a final check of the car, Davy tell him that he'll let him race next week.\n\nHowever, during the race, Davy's car suddenly comes loose and flips in a horrific crash. He's rushed to the hospital as Skip stands silent.\n\nIn a powerful twist, the next day, the mysterious sponsor tells Skip he looks forward to seeing him race on Saturday.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Rendered in beautiful photography, the moors become almost a fourth character, lending moodiness and foreboding with the dark roads and moonlit fields. The landscape possesses an almost mythic beauty -- but it's also where deep secrets are buried.\n\nThe precise control of plot -- and the mystery at the heart of these characters' stories -- is almost guaranteed to keep an audience invested. But the emotions underlying the extreme situation are actually quite universal: nearly every child confronts the fact that their parents aren't quite who they seem to be.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

On a dark, restless night, he decides they're having dinner together -- a meal of crabs he cooks himself -- and goads her into taking a bath and dressing up, although he also seems forgetful and erratic.\n\nIn her room, Sunny discovers that Don is actually a renowned author who disappeared from the world's stage after a fabled career. She also discovers his tortured family background: a wife who died by suicide, a daughter lost to time.\n\nAt dinner, these two lost and lonely souls hammer at their crabs and slowly open up to one another, in a wary back-and-forth that reveals the damage Sunny carries, flashes of Don's former brilliance, his present sorry state -- and the unexpected connection they have.\n\nWriter-director Zach Bandler's powerful drama begins with hypnotic, sweeping views of a coastline and the dark, restless waters of an ocean, all captured with ravishingly moody cinematography.\n\nIn the midst of such raw, desolate natural beauty, though, a small chamber drama takes place in a lighthouse, where the story's two lonely, damaged souls face off over dinner. What unfolds takes some time to suss out, but it unfurls into a powerful story about reconciliation, communication and how the forgiveness and sense of witness we desire from the people who hurt us never quite happens the way we anticipate.\n\nThe intimate scale of this drama puts the focus on the undercurrents of tension that build up between the two actors, who offer intense, gripping performances that emerge as some of the film's best, most memorable assets. Oscar-nominated actor Bruce Davison powerfully essays the role of a once-great, now-forgotten literary lion with a garrulous ease and charm. But his surface hospitality and generosity mask a deep sadness about his current state that seeps out despite his best efforts.\n\nThat push-pull also invites the hostility of his guest Sunny, played by SAG-nominated actress Meg Steedle -- known for \"Boardwalk Empire\" -- who brings to life the role of a damaged military veteran who seethes with long-simmering resentment and palpable discomfort in the world. Don senses this, provoking and stinging her with passive-aggressive barbs. The emotional mystery is just why Sunny so guarded and angry and why Don becomes the focus of that anger. When it finally emerges just how Sunny and Don are entwined, it propels a painful but much-needed opening of truth and emotion that leads to the film's final movement, which offers both a reckoning and a quiet grace note of forgiveness.\n\nBoth performances in \"The Lightkeeper\" are many-layered and complex, and both actors are able to invoke years of emotional burden, whether it's in how rigidly Sunny holds herself or the jovial yet controlling way Don orders Sunny around. Yet by hearing one another out and granting forgiveness, the film makes a powerful point about the role that it plays in lightening those burdens. It isn't absolving another of the hurtful impact of their actions, but a gift that you give to yourself to let go of anger and resentment -- and then move forward, able to embrace the freedom and possibility of the future.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The brand of comedy explored is awkward yet strongly rooted in real, genuine hurt, making for funny, intelligent but uncomfortable viewing.\n\nEach beat and turn in the arc. of the character is well-crafted, resting on a terrifically searching, honest and funny performance by actor Rachel Stubbings, who carries the majority of the film's dialogue and emotions with a deft blend of genuine emotion and crack comic timing. She elicits great empathy and compassion, underplaying her raw hurt while allowing for it to bubble up at just the most touching moments.\n\n\"Whenever You're Ready\" derives its wry, subtle comedy from the gulf between our inner turmoil and the carefully smooth surfaces of \"real life\" that demands we submerge our feelings in the name of making a living and keeping others comfortable. But the feelings have a surprising way of coming out, and when they do, the result is riveting, unsettling and highly memorable.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Learn more at http://omele.to/2QAUaZh.\n\nTHE BEST OF OMELETO\n\u00bb Celebrities on Omeleto: http://omele.to/celebrities\n\u00bb Best of Omeleto: http://omele.to/best\n\u00bb Millions on Omeleto: http://omele.to/millions\n\nOMELETO ON SOCIAL\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/omeletocom\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/omeletocom\nReddit: http://reddit.com/r/omeleto\n\nAva, a young 13-year-old girl, needs to buy a new swimsuit before a family excursion. Finding just the right thing, though, proves more difficult than she anticipates, especially in the company of her mother Kelly and little brother Wally.\n\nWriter-director Greta Nash's short drama focuses its narrative lens on a fraught moment in most girls' lives: buying a swimming suit for a body that is changing quickly. It's a slender story, but with its attention to emotional nuance and its emphasis on specific yet naturalistic performance, it's able to take a moment in one girl's life and turn it into a meditation of body image, coming-of-age, self-love and what it means to become a woman.\n\nWith its focus on Ava's interiority, performance is a key element of the film, with the main burden falling upon young performer Freya Van Dyke-Goodman to carry the subtle arc of Ava. Delivered with ease and naturalness,  she captures both the spiky sense of defensiveness and self-protection -- any mother and daughter will be deeply familiar with Ava's fraught yet vulnerable interaction with her mother.\n\nIn the dressing room, Ava is confronted with her insecurities, vulnerability and complexity of her changing role in life, as well as her conflicting inner needs for both comfort and independence. It's a tricky balancing act for both character and filmmaker, but the short manages to grace this rite of passage with just the right weight.\n\nThe small family is captured with naturalistic camerawork and lighting, capturing the sense of a film being almost a postcard of a small but pivotal moment in a young girl's life. And its denouement is equally as quiet and even gently lovely, as Ava slowly lets go of her self-consciousness for the moment and enjoys the beach.\n\n\"Two Piece\" is a small, even delicate short about a moment that feels outsized for its main character as she stands between childhood and adulthood and all its burdens. By capturing Ava at her most difficult -- and also at her most innocent and joyful -- the film seems to suggest that we never quite leave our young selves behind, but instead layer new experiences and knowledge over them, like a transparency. If we're lucky -- and we have the right support and foundation -- we never lose sight of the comforts of our past, even as we move forward into the future.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

It's a quiet life, but when a sick girl named Beverly arrives, along with her mother, Russ becomes fascinated by the pair.\n\nHe befriends the girl, but Beverly's Mom intervenes. Russ tried to keep his connection to Beverly going, but their secret friendship only leads to heartbreak, in a way he never expected.\n\nDirected by Eric Schuman and written by Inger Dietrichs and Eric Schuman, this short drama conjures a powerful atmosphere of tension and disquiet, aided by a strong script and compelling performances, especially by the two young leads, Gio Schwab and Nicolina Marra. Intelligent, intimate camerawork captures their loneliness and longing for connection, as well as the insular existences they both long to break out of.\n\n\"Proxy\" is essentially a coming-of-age tale about two young people trying to strike out into the larger world with some degree of autonomy and independence. But the film is enriched by its fascinating study of illness, power and vulnerability, creating a powerful sense of mystery that propels viewers forward.

He spends most of his days wandering around and getting into trouble, mouthing off at neighbors. He has a hard-edged attitude, a smart mouth and a spiky personality that's not afraid to get scrappy, whether it's with his big brother or neighbors in his small world.\n\nBy all accounts, Paul seems like a \"problem child,\" or even a social delinquent in training. But as he wanders around, Paul discovers strange beautiful moments of connection and lyricism -- and gives himself a chance to be the young boy he is inside, rather than the one that the world sees.\n\nWriter-director Richard Gorodecky's luminous short drama is a hidden jewel of a character portrait that upends expectations about growing up a \"problem child\" in a rough part of town.\n\nPaul is easy to dismiss and pigeonhole as a product of his environment, and the first part of the film catalogs his character in this light. He is, as the title mentions, a big pain with a bad attitude. The restless camerawork and focus on Paul's roughly urban environs -- he's often framed behind the fence's bars or overwhelmed by the urban features -- seems to underscore its influence in shaping him, giving the first part of the film a gritty, urban feel.\n\nBut as the film proceeds, the storytelling slowly unfurls a different side of Paul, as he has quiet moments of exploration and wonderment that reveal him to be as sensitive, imaginative and vulnerable as any other child in the world. The sound design here emphasizes the natural world he finds himself in, particularly with water and birds, and the black-and-white cinematography endows Paul's experience with an idyllic halo, emphasizing beauty, captivation and contemplation. The film and story gives Paul space to breathe and live, and allows him to temporarily escape the burden of bad expectations.\n\nYoung actor Badger Skelton is able to navigate both ends of Paul's characterization, with a beautifully responsive, naturalistic performance that feels spontaneous and unforced. An encounter with a fisherman -- played by actor Tommy Jessop -- reveals that Paul is perfectly capable of openness, kindness and curiosity, especially when he's treated as just another kid, rather than looked at as a pest or problem. Together they share a moment of both peace and excitement that flips the initial construction of Paul's character around, revealing him as just another kid capable of childlike wonder and innocence.\n\nIt's not until the last part of \"Little Shit\" that Paul's fuller story and background are revealed, delineating his difficulties at home and the emotional burdens he carries. It's an intelligently structured reveal that plays with the audience's own expectations about Paul, and part of the film's larger project to deepen compassion for children who seem difficult but are truly vulnerable and in need of care and tenderness underneath it all.\n\nSo many children can summon protective surfaces that are harder, tougher and more grown-up than they actually are. But sadly, sometimes this is all the world sees, and it becomes easy to put kids in a box that eventually will shape their still-developing sense of self. The duality of Paul's experience, as captured in this expressionistic, lyrical short, shows children are still children, full of vulnerability but also great potential, if properly tended to -- and deserving of deeper empathy and understanding, no matter what.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Matty arranges fights and collects bets while Dan fights, often escaping the irate gatherings by the skin of their teeth.\n\nBut despite the constant fog of drunkenness, Dan soon begins to suspect that Matty is ripping him off, hiding some of his earnings from him. The confrontation becomes about more than money, though -- and comes at just about the most inopportune time for both boxer and manager.\n\nWriter/director Evin O'Neill, along with co-writer Dara O'Neill, has fashioned a handsomely filmed Irish short that highlights both the beautiful Irish countryside and the hardscrabble life of the time, where bare-knuckled fights become piecemeal entertainment. Viewers would be forgiven in thinking that the film is a lushly appointed historical drama at first, with its gorgeous cinematography and elegant camerawork serving as a somewhat ironic backdrop for an ugly, brutal milieu.\n\nBut as the storytelling proceeds, the lens gradually hones in on the dynamic between Dan and Matty. At first, it seems to be a bond of a somewhat professional nature, or perhaps a troubled soul and an enabler. But their witty, often spiky banter reveals something closer and more brotherly in many ways, and actors Chris Tordoff and Dara O'Neill portray Matty and Dan with a great sense of begrudging reliance upon one another, a mutual dependence that may not be healthy, perhaps, but has a latent quality of connection to it.\n\nAfter Dan begins to suspect Matty of ripping him off, however, the emotional minefield between the two men is exposed, and the film really takes off in terms of finding its unique voice. It reveals a scrappy, delightful combination of bromantic comedy, farcical touches and sincere emotion.\n\nSome may wish that \"Digs for Pennies\" revealed its tonal sleight-of-hand earlier on, but the reveal functions well as both an emotional build-up and a comical climax. The drama comes from a genuine and sincere (albeit loud) expression of vulnerable sentiment; the comedy comes from the circumstances and timing. But the combination results in an ending that is equal parts funny and heartwarming.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The drama is excellently paced, keeping viewers drawn in with juicy tension and conflict.\n\nThe cinematography and editing is loose and fun, evoking a creative, shambolic existence that feels constantly improvised and revised -- and very true to the world of a creative young adult trying to find her place in the world while others around her seem to fall into success with ease. Perfectly calibrated performances bring a smart, sophisticated script to life, illuminating a complicated portrait of female friendship and competition.\n\nIn her quest to clear her name, Emily experiences a shift in self-perception, moving from a place of self-loathing to one of self-acceptance. Fans of female-focused sharp-edged urban fare -- think \"Girls,\" for example -- will find the deep interest in one woman's quest to speak her truth deeply fascinating.\n\nIn an age where \"empowerment\" has become a marketing term, \"F Is for Friendship\" is a true lesson in what it means to claim your power, take responsibility for your life -- and create authenticity in the process.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But one director, Leslie, doesn't want to go that route, convinced that a human actor could only deliver the rich, compelling performance she needs for her film.\n\nBut Karen, her producer, and the movie studio they're working with want her to audition a few sprites, in order to keep production costs low. Leslie reluctantly tries out a few sprites at the audition --where they act out a scene from \"Star Trek: Wrath of Khan\" -- and eventually encounters the holographic projection Jim.\n\nSkeptical and determined to get her human actor, Leslie is hard on Jim. But Jim surprises her with unexpected glimmers of humanity and understanding, challenging her perceptions of the limitations of artificial intelligence.\n\nWriter-director Kyle Bogart's short sci-fi dramedy is unique for the genre in that it puts its focus on character and performance. There is less VFX razzle-dazzle here, and a simplicity in both its visuals and execution. But in the place of spectacle is both gently playful comedy and a surprisingly heartfelt interrogation of the potential, unexpected humanity that could be found in artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile most films with a sci-fi bent are visual showpieces, here the emphasis is on the feelings and interactions. The film takes place in one location, and though the camera work is sensitive and thoughtful, its focus is on capturing the ebbs and flows of thoughts and feelings of the main characters, particularly the flinty, contentious director and the sprites auditioning for her.\n\nThe guiding lights of the narrative are the excellent writing and performances, which are never exaggerated, taking place in a register of human expression that feels realistic and rooted in the actual emotional situations. Actors Liz Beckham and Lee Eddy play the director and producer whose barbed back-and-forth over the film's production form much of the comedic edge of the film, while actor Kriston Woodreaux nails both the amiable bundle of expressions and mannerisms of a programmed fascimile of human personality, while giving a glimpse of the sprite's learning, thinking and longings.\n\nIt is this questioning and longing that comes to intrigue Lesley, especially as Jim unexpectedly reveals a disarming vulnerability and awareness of his own self and consciousness. Every emotional beat of this part of the scene unfolds with an almost breathtaking delicacy and care, knocking out both viewers and Leslie with an openness that is deeply and surprisingly moving.\n\nAs Jim takes this emotional discovery and puts it into his monologue, the careful, measured build-up at the beginning of \"Sprites\" pays off with a rich, emotionally satisfying ending that challenges Leslie's perception of artificial intelligence, entertains genuinely deep questions about the possibilities of artificial intelligence -- and explores a notion of humanity rooted not just in the body, but in the potential for self-awareness and growth.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But when she gets sick, Tom has a difficult decision to make: give her up to the authorities, who will take her away, or risk getting infected himself.\n\nWritten and directed by Paul Cooke and Dominic Rees-Roberts, this drama has a premise worthy of science fiction. But with its attention to emotion and relationship and its beautiful evocation of the bond between parent and child, it's also a compelling family drama about loyalty and love in the face of even the direst of circumstances.\n\nThe craftsmanship in particular prizes a closely held intimacy and attention, staying close within the domestic sphere of the family. The writing focuses exclusively on the father and his daughter, tracing their close bond, and is brought to life by understated yet profoundly moving performances by actors Lollie McKenzie and Henry Douthwaite as Amy and Tom.\n\nThe action is situated entirely around the house, and is shot with a muted, cool light and naturalistic camerawork that captures both a sense of subtle but chilling isolation and the fragile tenderness of a family home. As a result, the world has a feel of hushed suspension that seems almost idyllic at times -- until viewers realize it's because so many people that populated the world are gone silent because of death, quarantine and illness.\n\nBut even in the midst of pandemics, children get restless and parents become overprotective, and a natural conflict between them becomes raised to dangerous stakes. Once Tom realizes Amy has been infected, he is put in a terrible position as a father and a human being, and those dangerous stakes lead to a decision that will be tragic, no matter how it plays out.\n\nIt's impossible to watch \"Catch\" and not think about today's own epidemics. Made in consultation with scientists and doctors who are experts in the subject of antibiotic resistance, the short credibly brings to life a public health threat that is all too real in today's world, with a lucid, intelligent sense of craft and performance that keep it from becoming a well-meaning but overly earnest \"issue of the week\" movie.\n\nBut in the midst of talk of diseases, medicines and vaccines, \"Catch\" reminds us that sometimes abstract ideas of science have deeply human consequences and resonance. Through its moving and heartwrenching narrative, it evokes just how intimately and emotionally these public news issues can affect us -- and just how powerful familial love can be, making difficult choices even more heart-rending and reminding us just what is at stake.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Lost in her own world and thoughts -- as well as being deaf -- she is oblivious at first to the stranger who begins to share her spot on the pier, trying to photograph the local scene.\n\nEventually, they strike up a conversation via hand gestures and facial expressions, and Sophie and Bemo spend the afternoon together, forming an unlikely bond that flourishes despite their lack of shared language. But that growing bond and attraction is challenged in its own way, and what seems like a straightforward romance becomes a meditation on attraction, love and the vivid, fleeting nature of it all.\n\nWriter-director Michael Aloyan's short romance traces the beginning of an attraction, beginning with the requisite \"meet cute\" and proceeding until what's traditionally regarded as the next step. Charming, simple but beautifully shot and well-performed, watching two different individuals find common ground and then attraction is lovely, especially when the storytelling highlights how their lack of shared language seemingly makes space for a more intimate, vulnerable connection.\n\nThere isn't much dialogue in the film, but strong sound design offers a glimpse of what's it like to be in Sophie's head, experiencing music as rhythmic thumps and exploring a subjectivity that is rich in sensation, even if she can't hear sound. Sharing some of that with Bemo forms one of the most evocative and heart-warming moments in the film, and it's easy to see why they become so taken with one another.\n\nActress T.J. Carpio plays Sophie's hearing impairment lightly, but traces her growing openness to Bemo with great responsiveness and emotional honesty. Actor Shvan Aladdin plays off her well as Bemo, essaying a role notable for its warmth and kindness, and the two's connection flourishes, even if they don't seem to have much-shared ground yet.\n\nAs Sophie and Bemo develop other ways to share their selves and lives outside of spoken conversation, the film seems to function as a romantic montage leading to a high point of consummation, gracefully threading through their growing intimacy in a series of beautifully etched vignettes. But in a subtle but clever set of twists, the storytelling upends those narrative expectations, making what seems like a straightforward romance into something unexpectedly meditative and even melancholy.\n\nWithout giving too much away, \"Noise\" seems to question just what the origin of attraction is, what role and importance common ground -- whether it's through shared language or other values -- plays in love and what do we gain or give up when rushing into romance. This narrative turn is gently accomplished without melodrama, but it's enough that when the would-be couple comes back together, the emotional tenor of the story is markedly different from the beginning. It's not unlike real life, perhaps, when the beautiful \"castle in the sky\" created by two people's mutual romantic fantasy and momentum reveals itself as the fragile edifice it is -- and the couple must decide what's really holding it up, and whether that's enough to sustain it.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They use Skype, send texts, FaceTime and even talk on the phone.\n\nBut over the course of one evening, a typical catch-up conversation escalates into bickering, and soon the couple must reckon with exactly what is keeping them together, and just what their future will be.\n\nWriter Meryl Hathaway, who also plays Ava, and director Jacquie Phillips have crafted a perceptive comedy about communication, intimacy and just how difficult relationships can be, especially when both parties are still evolving in life, work and character.\n\nThe film's foundation rests on an excellent, relatable script, which drills down through the levels of communication between couples as Ava and Peter talk. It begins with the sharing of quotidian experiences and details in an attempt to connect and bond with one another: the asking after work, the sharing of anecdotes, even the inside long-running jokes. These seem easy enough for Ava and Peter, who have an easygoing banter and chemistry, even over screens.\n\nBut then it progresses into more deep-rooted needs and conflicts like sex, connection, intimacy and stability, and here Ava and Peter are on shakier ground. They want to meet their respective desires for connection in mutually exclusive ways, and once they realize the gap, it opens up a bigger, less bridgeable rift. In order to repair it, they need to be on the same page -- and that sadly may not be the case.\n\nActors Hathaway -- who appears in the critically acclaimed comedy \"The Good Place\" -- and Tyler Labine ably navigate the progression from light-hearted comedy to heartfelt drama with great chemistry, making it easy to believe that this is a couple with a long-running history. The camerawork that captures them onscreen gets increasingly more intimate as their conversations become more open and vulnerable, until the final moments, which bring us up close and personal with their final heartbreaking revelations.\n\n\"It's Your Call\" is an intimate two-hander, which is arguably one of the most common narrative structures in short film. Yet when done with emotional honesty and a spirit of sincerity, it never fails to make a case that the most challenging journeys in human life are often the emotional ones. That's the case with this short relationship dramedy, which shows that even when armed with an arsenal of tech tools, it's never easy to communicate or hear life-changing truths, even when it's necessary.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He left his hometown three years ago, but only now has returned, just in time to face awkward questions from friends and family -- and make amends with his ex-girlfriend Kara on her wedding day.\n\nBut the meeting doesn't go quite as planned, leading Jacob and Kara on an unexpected path of reckoning.\n\nCo-writer and director Jacob Kirby has fashioned a romantic drama that's engrossing for its visual beauty, its sensitively observed performances and the emotional resonance it elicits.\n\nOn paper, the story reads like a romantic comedy, but the care the film takes to paint its world and characters has the depth of a great drama, marrying the two genres in a warmly organic way. The beginning of the short may be placid and even quiet, but the build-up leads to a richly warm, sad yet almost funny encounter that changes both their lives.\n\nAny film about relationships succeeds based on how engaging the performers are, both separately and together. Happily, the short features two leads who are able to delineate the specific beats of their separate journeys with care, and then have terrific ease and chemistry when they finally intersect.\n\nBeyond strong natural performances, the film has an almost classical approach to its craft, marrying stately cinematography and perfectly calibrated editing to create a seamless experience for viewers to get drawn into. We never lose sight of where Duncan and Kara are at when it comes to the feelings they inspire in one another, and we also see the painstaking way they try to negotiate their emotions after such a long absence.\n\nThe result is a well-crafted, solid film about love, care and emotional vulnerability. Opening your heart, being honest: these are the moments that call for courage and bravery in everyday real life, and \"At Ease\" portrays the tension and struggle with honesty and tenderness.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Both recently dumped by their significant others, they are forced to work together delivering flowers on Valentine's Day -- and confront their own romantic foibles in the process.\n\nThis short romantic comedy has a rhythm of its own, weaving its story around rat-a-tat witty dialogue. With each delivery, the duo encounter the gamut of strange behavior, situations and relationships, ranging from romantic assignations to even funerals.\n\nThe feel of the film is loose and even improvisational in feeling, true to the internal rhythms of its main characters, and the structure of the story allows the film to canvas the full range of emotions that Valentine's Day often inspires in others.\n\nBut as the two slackers spend time together and get to know one another more deeply, they're able to grapple with their hidden hurts and vulnerabilities, which allow them to work out their feelings -- and their last obstacles to love and connection.\n\n\"Allergic to Flowers\" is both deeply acerbic and very sweet, finally revealing its emotions on its guarded sleeve. Like many romantic comedies, it provides a brief but poignant lesson in sentimental education, prizing honesty and authenticity over the pretty illusions of typical romance.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

No one else can compete with the soundtrack in her mind.\n\nBeautifully shot with earnest, charming performances, this unique drama blends music video with storytelling, and features an evocative score by Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, who has collaborated with director Adam Neufstadter before.\n\nThe result is a tender, lovely, bittersweet parable about how the noise in our minds -- as compelling as it is -- often gets in the way of being truly present in our life. But connecting with others through vulnerability and openness makes anything possible.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Seeking her attention, he tries gambit after gambit to win her over.\n\nFirst, he seeks her attention by trying to play roles that she may find intriguing, but neither masculine posturing or pseudo-intellectual posing capture her attention. But just when he has given up, he gets an unexpected second chance -- and realizes there's another route to his beloved's heart.\n\nWriter-director Mark Playne's sweet-natured, warm-hearted short romance has a charming, almost old-fashioned look and feel, as well as an unabashed pleasure in the inherent beauty and magic of cinema to transform and captivate viewers in its classic tale of love and courtship.\n\nTold without dialogue, the storytelling nevertheless has a progression that's as old as time itself: boy sees girl, falls in love and tries to gain her attention. The pacing is aided by an excellent musical score, which shifts seamlessly from cafe music to jazz to plaintive guitars, capturing the flickering hopes and confusion of the striving main character. It's a pleasure simply to listen to the film on its own -- a creative strategy that also ties in beautifully at the film's conclusion.\n\nThe score also gives an inherent musicality to the film itself, which is also aided by its vibrant colors and sweeping camera movements. Though the city blocks are narrow and the apartments small, the visual approach injects movement and color into the story, endowing the setting and story with poetry and whimsy. The main narrative beats are interjected with short scenes of the city itself, full of dogs walking on the sidewalk, old men and women tending to friendships and homes and children playing in the street. These interjections open up the film -- and pay off with its lovely grace note of an ending, as the spell of love works itself in an unexpected way.\n\n\"Love at First Sight\" harkens back to an earlier golden age of cinema, where films seek to entertain and transport audiences not just through engaging, emotional narratives but through the magic of moving pictures themselves. Through its lovely melding of score, sound and image, it's a sweet and charming romance that is unafraid of the inherent emotion of its genre.\n\nAnd through capturing the beauty of a paper falling in the window, the colors of a building, or the humming of a beautiful girl in a cafe, it also encourages viewers to seek and behold the magic and romance of our own everyday lives -- a reminder and encouragement that is needed more than ever.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But in the midst of it all, she's still a young woman coming of age and preparing to go to the Irish version of the prom -- the \"debs\" -- with her boyfriend Darren.\n\nBut when her preparations for the big event are in danger of derailment from her mother -- and her social anxieties about fitting in can't be allayed easily -- Lana's big night is almost ruined. But Darren offers her an act of devotion that offers her support and shelter, giving her the strength to give and receive love.\n\nDirector Brendan Canty and co-writer Alan O'Gorman have created a genuinely romantic, uplifting drama about what it means to really love someone and be there when your loved one needs you the most. The film's achievement is in how it eschews genre cliches of both teen films and romantic melodrama to offer a realistic portrayal of young love, making its ending all the more well-earned and heartwarming.\n\nThe success of the short rests on the subtle yet well-calibrated storytelling, which captures the nuances and texture of Lana's life with clarity and a lack of melodrama. Lana's life has its difficulties, and the short but tense scenes of her home life ably capture the volatility and hostility she faces from her alcoholic mother. Lana  tries to get through her life as well as she can, and part of her solace comes in the form of her boyfriend Darren.\n\nThe film especially shines with the nuanced, beautifully warm performances by the central couple in question, played by performers Barry Keoghan -- seen in \"Dunkirk\" and \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\" -- and newcomer Gabby Murphy, who deftly portrays the disappointment, anger and ultimately sadness of dealing with an alcoholic parent while trying to carve out a life of her own.\n\nEven though the relationship seems to be in its early phases -- and Lana hasn't fully opened up about her family difficulties with Darren yet -- the couple's humor, chemistry and affection are apparent, making it easy for them to root for.\n\nShot in a gritty, naturalistic way that captures the unglamorous environs of inner city Dublin as well as the difference between Lana and Darren's worlds, it has an almost documentary feel visually. But the offhand, observational approach works beautifully with the film's emotional register, giving it nuance and realism.\n\nIn the middle of Lana's fraught, uncertain world, Darren and the support he offers stands out. And when Lana falls apart emotionally as the pressures of her home life and social life collide, his act of kindness stands out in Lana's emotionall deprived world as something genuinely beautiful and meaningful for Lana -- which then enables her to give love elsewhere, where it's especially lacking and much needed.\n\n\"For You\" stands out in a field of romantic drama as an emotionally mature and intelligent take on love, with an especial lack of romantic film cliches, whether it's a reunion scene in the rain or a kiss set to a soaring orchestral score. By keeping its approach rooted in Lana's social reality, Darren's loyalty, kindness and love for her stand out for its steadfastness and generosity.\n\nBecause the film is authentic and unvarnished, Darren's act of love isn't a case of a knight in shining armor rescuing a girl, but the act of offering support and care when someone needs it the most -- and ultimately, a true example of unconditional love, which gives us the strength to grant it selflessly to others.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Dylan has cooked the meal, the lighting is set low and everything looks ready for a romantic evening.\n\nBut as their dinner proceeds, a hidden layer of long-term grievances and complaints starts to emerge, though it doesn't quite surface... yet.\n\nDirector and co-writer Charlie Reader -- along with co-writer Peter Fellows -- trains a darkly ironic eye in this sharp, acerbic and emotionally unvarnished snapshot of a couple in a comfortable, established relationship, one that clearly chafes in subtle yet distinctive ways for both parties.\n\nThough it's a comedy with relationships at its core, it's not a \"romantic comedy\" in the traditional sense of the genre. Instead, the storytelling's barbed, sometimes ribald humor is aimed at exploring the hidden doubts, fears and insecurities of people, and how relationships often muffle honesty at the expense of emotional vitality for both the individuals and the relationship itself.\n\nMuch of the film's dramatic tension and humor is carried through the excellent dialogue, which toggles between expressing the characters' innermost thoughts and the reality of what their actual conversation is. The gap between the banality of their \"real\" dialogue and the often incendiary anger and bitterness of their inner one is hilarious, pointed and (scarily) believable. The adroit editing deftly blurs the line between fantasy and reality, but it also builds a dynamic between the couple that is both specific and archetypal, involving a simmering set of unspoken resentments and complaints that both Dylan and Reyes hide underneath casual chit-chat and domestic small talk.\n\nThe narrative scale is confined to dinner at home, but the craftsmanship still feels quite rich and expressive, whether it's in the darkly elegant look of the visuals that veers between intimate and claustrophobic, or the impressionistic sound design, which gestures at Dylan and Reyes's internal emotional landscapes in quiet yet witty ways. The score also punctuates the humor of the film, adding an ironic, almost operatic flourish to what becomes two dueling arias of psychological discontent.\n\nActors Christian Cooke and Olga Kurylenko -- who also played the role of Bond girl Camille Montes in Quantum of Solace -- stay true to the thornier emotions underlying the words while delivering them with a lightness of touch and a musicality in the rhythm. Both performers clearly have fun with saying the things usually left unsaid between couples, but they also hit at the real, more vulnerable fears and doubts that they hold inside them. Sometimes a real, genuine tenderness and hurt seem to bubble up in these moments -- but then it's shrouded in defensiveness, anger and uncertainty, leaving the ultimate fate of the couple uncertain.\n\nSophisticated, and polished in execution but savage in its wit, \"Everything You Didn't Say\" explores the impulses of incivility that arise in long-term monogamous couples, and provokes thought about whether or not such arrangements are compatible or viable. But its most interesting interrogations come from teasing the compromises between honesty and keeping the peace between couples, and exposing just how difficult -- yet vital -- communication is. But what is the fine line between being too honest but more open? That may be a potentially scary terrain that couples need to explore -- though without a real roadmap to get them there.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As he wanders the gigantic lot, he comes across a beautiful woman named Maya, who has also forgotten her location.\n\nThe two call the help point, where an agent named Stephen helps to locate their vehicles, leaving Jack and Maya to chat while they wait. But the conversation doesn't go quite the way that Jack expects.\n\nWritten and directed by Andrew Margetson, this charming, witty and unexpected romantic short is undeniably well-crafted in its astute directing, relatable and compelling performances and clever writing, and all these elements are woven together with a certain lightness and ease that never feels heavy-handed.\n\nInstead, there's a quietly steady foundation of excellence all around in the craftsmanship. The camera work and cinematography are never flamboyant and are in fact rather muted, offering a sense of realism. And as the storytelling develops with equally steady pacing, we seem to be heading into serious drama territory, as the two characters deal with the unexpected vulnerability that has bubbled up.\n\nActors Cian Barry and Ruta Getmintas play Jack and Maya with a responsiveness and openness that draws viewers in, both in the interpersonal trauma being revealed and the build-up between two strangers who may have a spark between them.\n\nBut just when the narrative seems to go down one road, it deftly pivots with a puncture of a plot \"twist\" that steers it into unexpected, but highly entertaining, territory. What's more, the story takes this shift and runs with it, playing it out with the same ease and excellence -- much to Jack's chagrin, but the audience's delight.\n\nRomantic narratives require one or both characters to overcome obstacles in order to be together, and part of the interest and pleasure is watching the potential work through these to be together. But the obstacles that Jack eventually deals with in his attempts to impress and connect with Maya are so unexpected and funny that they bring a freshness to the romance format while keeping the film's appealing naturalness in tone and execution and illustrating an old dictum we never get tired of. All is fair in love and war, as the saying goes -- and you never know where the next adversary will pop up.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

This makes it hard for him to connect with people, much less get through many tasks of university life.\n\nBut after a disastrous exam, he retreats to the library, where he meets Carly, a hard-of-hearing classmate who makes a connection with him that goes beyond sound.\n\nWritten and directed by Sy Huq, this short isn't quite your typical \"meet cute\" scenario. Though on paper the story is definitely a simple yet effective case of \"boy meets girl,\" its attention to character and its scrupulous construction of what it feels like to experience what it is like to \"hear voices\" add a unique dimension, as does its commitment to representing deaf and hard-of-hearing characters in a fuller, richer way.\n\nSound is a key element in the film, and here it takes center stage, starting with the beginning sequence -- recorded in a 360-degree binaural audio soundscape -- that layers a dense, distracting collage of voices, noises and everyday sounds against images of Alex taking his midterms.\n\nHe finds relief only by listening to music on his headphones, which are quickly taken away by his professor, who doesn't understand how Alex is plagued by auditory hallucinations. The segment puts us in Alex's subjective headscape -- its intricacy and sculpted quality sounds remarkable, especially when wearing headphones -- and helps us understand what it is like to be in his world, and what assault he can be under when he experiences his auditory hallucinations.\n\nThe craftmanship and camera initially have a muted realism that seems suited towards drama, especially as it immerses us in Alex's experience. The storytelling that develops, though, is one of a slowly developing connection between two people, as they notice and take interest in one another.\n\nThe film never quite allows itself to get carried away with this narrative thread -- it's constantly interrupted either by Jack's auditory assaults, or moments of comic relief by an overly irritable librarian -- but it also keeps the film from getting too sentimental, cutting out just as Jack meets the one girl who has a radically different relationship with sound and hearing -- and who connects with him on a level that is both very relatable and very special.\n\n\"Things That Fall\" feels like the first chapter in a bigger love story, and many viewers will likely want to see these characters develop and grow in their relationship with one another. Other viewers may long to see more of such a sensitively rendered representation of a much-maligned and misunderstood mental condition and perhaps see the love story as superfluous.\n\nBut that would be going against the film's overall mission, especially since it balances the delicate line between accurately portraying what it might be like to have to live with schizophrenia without \"othering\" the mental illness too much or defining a character entirely by it. Alex and Carly are both dealing with conditions that impede their daily lives in some way or another. But they're still people, who yearn and struggle to be seen and understood. They're still worthy of being included in love stories because all human beings strive towards connection with one another -- no matter what our struggles or condition. Alex and Carly have much to learn from one another -- just like how viewers have much to learn about these characters' experiences and lives. We get a short glimpse of it here, and thanks to this thoughtfully crafted story, will likely be curious for more.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

It's their first date, and their conversation is filled with the sharing of interests and ideas... and those first \"butterfly\" moments of mutual romantic attraction. But as the date proceeds, the pair unravel a deeper, connection between them -- one filled with a surprising heartache.\n\nThis gentle, resonant drama -- directed by Kieran Thompson and written by Chris Heck -- initially begins as a romance, with a situation familiar to many films of that genre. Like many other first dates on film, conflicting micro-emotions flicker between Tom and Ingrid: hesitancy, interest, shyness, discovery and delight. Part of the pleasure for viewers is watching the connection between characters grow with each narrative and character beat. With skilled writing, acting and directing -- all of which is abundant here -- the audience begins to root for this potential couple as their own familiarity with the characters grows, too. In many of the best romances, viewers will fall in love with the characters, as they fall in love with one another.\n\nActors Christine Kellogg-Darrin and Elester Latham bring Ingrid and Tom to life, with rich, empathetic performances with an innate sympathy. There's an instant kindness and warmth between them that perfectly illustrates that much-fabled feeling of knowing someone well, even if you've just met. And that's what seems to be happening initially between them as the film proceeds. \n\nBut there's just something slightly different about this particular romance, beyond its focus on an older couple in a genre that's often geared to the young. The craftsmanship has an unusual thoughtfulness and meditative quality, privileging care and stillness over-energetic pacing or plot-driven momentum. The lovely but muted color palette imbues the images with a luminosity, but they possess an undertow of melancholy, thanks to the steady, almost searching camera movement and framing. \n\nThe action in the script is romance; the film language, though, feels like an elegiac drama. And ultimately, as the story quietly unfurls just why Tom and Ingrid seem so deeply connected to one another, its visual approach of tender, poetic care aligns with the full meaning of the narrative.\n\nHeartfelt and impeccably crafted, \"Wish You Were There\" captures the initial flutters of first-blush romance, no matter what the age of the people, with a genuine sweetness and pleasure. But it also captures the profound empathy and patience that a true long-term partnership requires. Ultimately, in the end, \"Wish You Were There\" becomes not just a romance, but a genuine, moving love story: a portrait of the steadfast devotion and tenderness that make for true, lasting love, no matter what the circumstances.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Director Natalie Erika James prizes restraint, creating burnished Gothic beauty with moody lighting and hypnotic camerawork, which also seem to reference tropes found in modern Asian horror films.\n\nUnderstated performances emphasizes the film's emotional core: revisiting childhood, and grappling with changing roles between an aging parent and their now-grown child.\n\nThe film slowly builds, carefully laying down the groundwork of suggestion with care and precision, until it pays off with a genuinely skin-tingling reveal that proves effective and frightening.\n\nWhile many horror films pump up the adrenaline and lean on shock, \"Creswick\" is all about dread, resulting in an eerie, beautifully spooky film whose chills linger in the blood well after viewing -- and whose visual panache elevate the short into a small cinematic jewel.\n\nFor those who want more after  the conclusion of \"Creswick,\" James is developing the short into a feature called \"Relic,\" which will shoot later in 2018.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But one day he is summoned by Lilith, a mother whose daughter is ill. He enters the strange house and meets daughter Alice, who is confined to bed.\n\nBut the doctor soon discovers that he has been sent to play a part of a larger, more elaborate cult ritual to bring rain to a drought-ridden commune -- and finds himself tested morally and in other ways as never before.\n\nWriter-director Grayson Whitehurst's short conceivable falls into a recent wave of highly stylized, atmospheric horror films about the occult. Shades of films like The Wicker Man and even The Witch clearly share some creative DNA with the storytelling, but Whitehurst's film is distinguished not just by its sweeping and elegant visual style and its excellent performances, but by its philosophical engagement on the ethics of mercy killings, and the myth of control and understanding over something as inexorable as death.\n\nThe narrative doesn't rely on shock or surprise to generate its interest, as it begins with a striking opening sequence of the cult itself, complete with unsettling, restless black-and-white images and an eerie and effective score.\n\nInstead, as the well-meaning doctor enters the milieu, the puzzle becomes about how the doctor learns about the larger context of his work and how it transforms his own understanding of his mercy killing.\n\nActor Atticus Cain as Dr. Goodman essays the role as a man who believes that his work is meaningful and services a valuable need. But as his fiery, righteous foil, actress Eileen Weisinger turns the table against him in a powerful performance, playing upon his sense of conviction and his own need to feel comfortable with what he is doing.\n\nWhen the doctor discovers how easily he is manipulated by forces beyond control, he realizes the line between being a murderer and an \"angel of death\" is blurred -- and he's completely unable to prevent the tragedy that happens.\n\nRiveting and beautifully crafted, \"A Handful of Dust\" is spookily engaging from beginning to end, but what makes it memorable is its remote undertow of melancholy. As the film moves towards its conclusion, it becomes increasingly dark and shadowy, with faces and figures held at a distance in the shadows.\n\nThe final end feeling isn't shock at what we've seen, or even relief that we've escaped peril. Instead, there is a pensive, almost numbing sadness and helplessness at how death is always senseless to those left behind, no matter how we try to control it.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

And when he finally snaps back to reality -- and discovers swarms of bats infesting his home -- it just might be too late.\n\nDirector Marcus Alqueres -- whose previous short was optioned for a feature by Sony -- uses consummate craft and tightly wound editing and pacing to ratchet up the tension in his horror short. The production value and camerawork and rich and expansive, creating a palpable sense of a world beyond what we see on the screen.\n\nThere are moments of wry humor laced throughout the action, as well as judicious use of special effects. But like the best films in the genre, \"Lasiurus\" delivers plenty of chills and dread with remarkable skill.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The mean girls at her high school have spread a heinous rumor about her through their school's gossip mill. But they have no idea that the object of their persecution is a witch with legit supernatural powers.\n\nSarah decides to use her powerful magic to conjure forth an entity called the Givertaker, who will enact her revenge upon the popular girl clique. But things take an unexpected turn when unleashing the Givertaker also unravels some tricky truths about Sarah herself.\n\nDirector Paul Gandersman and writer Peter S. Hall's horror short is both a clever homage to 90s-era high school films and a modern evocation of the Goosebumps series of novels for older kids. But it leavens its vein of nostalgia with a smart, emotionally perceptive take on the knotty complexities of female friendship that make it especially modern.\n\nLike other entertainments like Stranger Things, the story mines a particularly pleasurable vein of 90s nostalgia, from the bright, saturated cinematography to the rat-a-tat rhythm of the dialogue to the pitch-perfect costuming that could have come straight out of Delia's catalog. The traditional horror elements are kept at a subtle level, too. There's a chilling, dissonant score, but there's also a refreshing lack of jump scares or horror VFX.\n\nInstead, the horror and suspense come from the interpersonal dynamics of these seemingly mean girls, and the ways they undercut, undermine and jockey for domination over one another through social capital. The writing clearly has fun with the horror elements, but it actually is an examination of two friends outgrowing one another, and the way that social cruelty is a contagion. It takes seriously the emotional lives of its young female characters, letting these needs drive the actions of the characters. And though it's not feminist in agenda, its complex, even-handed representation of the teens and their relationships with one another are refreshing and nuanced.\n\nOf course, \"Givertaker\" is a horror film, and it pays off the genre expectations with a fantastic evocation of the titular creature, complete with otherworldly smoke and crashing metal soundtrack. Ultimately the Givertaker makes the final judgment call in this teen imbroglio, and though it's not surprising, it upends the typical expectations.\n\nFor those who loved Goosebumps in the 90s, \"Givertaker\" (and its forthcoming companion shorts in the Dead Kids Club series) updates the formula of \"scary books that are also funny\" with modern themes and emotional intelligence, all the while keeping the creepiness and subtle menace that come not just through the demons and ghouls, but from the difficulties of adolescence.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

It's their initiation into the next, higher level of the organization.\n\nSubjected to trials of speed, strength and endurance, they struggle to prove themselves and find themselves pitted against one another in order to win.\n\nBut one of them begins to realize that all is not what it seems with their scouting organization -- and discovering the truth unearths a darker side to both the \"order\" and the boys than anyone imagined.\n\nLike many other excellent thrillers, writer-director Chad Cunningham's suspenseful, action-packed short leans on impeccable craftsmanship to draw viewers into its meticulously drawn world and story.\n\nWhat stands out initially in this short film is its incredible camerawork, sound design and score, which all work together to create an atmosphere of suspense and tension that keeps the audience's curiosity alive.\n\nSmart, compelling visuals and fine performances by its mostly young cast parse out information about the world and characters like breadcrumbs that we -- and the lead young scout, Jackson -- follow avidly. The desire to poke beneath an initially innocuous or placid surface is irresistible to both the scouts and to the audience, and we uncover the secrets about the order just as Jackson does.\n\nThe story itself is a riff on classic themes explored in stories like \"Lord of the Flies\" -- the conflict between decency and civilization versus the savagery evoked by rivalry and competition for seemingly scarce resources and rewards. This is rich classical narrative territory, but the film approaches it with energy and self-assured verve.\n\nThe hidden world and secrets are dark, as is its final statement on human nature. But as a film, it's also just a lot of fun, and a sheer pleasure, to watch, using the art of superlative filmmaking to immerse an audience into its story and characters. Its confidence and craft beg for a feature-length treatment to fill out the characters and background, but at its current scale, \"The Order\" offers thrills and chills worthy of a multiplex.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But as a series of shockingly bloody occurrences pile up around her, Samantha begins to think her sweet kitty may be capable of murder.\n\nDirector Chris Jopp has crafted a dark and gleefully whimsical horror short, which mashes up 80s slasher flicks with elements of camp, comedy and film noir.\n\nThe tension is expertly ratcheted up with muscular camerawork, and moody cinematography that brings to mind great horror classics by Stephen King and other genre greats, which grounded horror in genuine emotional anxieties about life.\n\nLike stories and adaptations like \"Carrie,\" this short has its pulse on the real existential dilemma that Samantha faces as a young adult truly on her own for the first time, making it relatable.\n\nThe addition of goofy humor adds a dose of levity to the genuine chills and thrills the film provides, making \"Meow\" a genuinely fun ride in a twisted house of mirror, and an experience viewers won't easily forget.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Strangely intrigued, Ben's curiosity gets the better of him and he fishes the bag out of the oily water.\n\nWhen he opens the bag, he discovers a small notebook of names, as well as a 15-foot-long snake inside. He discovers it is an African Rock Python, but animal services is unable to remove it right away. He attempts to rid himself of the snake, but it becomes clear that the animal has developed an attachment to Ben and isn't going anywhere.\n\nBen becomes used to the snake's presence, just as strange things begin happening in his apartment building: a neighbor's dog goes missing, and other residents he shares his building (and more than a few conflicts with) disappear as well. Soon Ben realizes that the snake is much more than it seems, becoming a strange extension of his thoughts and will -- and wants to  guide him into a darker world than he ever anticipated.\n\nWriter-director Spencer Young's short horror film is a smart, gripping story about the will to power, the inner dark impulses we all struggling with, and the efforts we make to keep them from coming to surface.\n\nWell-crafted from its cinematography to its eerie sound design, it painstakingly constructs a world, while its writing deftly lays down the elements of its central dilemma and mystery.\n\nBoth gritty and atmospheric, it excels in depicting a milieu of both decaying modernity and the ancient evil lurking underneath the cracked, degraded surfaces. The short has the desaturated, almost bleak look of a British urban thriller, portraying city spaces as either open and desolate or cramped, almost moist with intimacy and proximity -- and ready to ripen with contagion.\n\nThe contagion here is not an epidemic, but rather a set of questionable disappearances, and the crowded apartment building with its long narrow hallways, cramped stairs and odd assortment of strange neighbors is an ideal playground for its latest reptilian inhabitant to wreak havoc. Actor Liam Boyle (from \"Skins\"), in a deft, sensitive performance of a loner in a city filled with many solitary souls, becomes the conduit through which the audience learns more about the snake -- and about humankind's capacity of evil and capability of corruption. By the time Ben catches up to the snake and understands his own relationship to it, the audience may wonder if he's beginning to enjoy its power as well.\n\nNarratively \"Repent Now\" feels like the first part of a longer feature work, especially with its almost cliffhanger-style ending. It doesn't have the time to delve deep into its mythos of good or evil -- or answers questions of where the snake came from or how it got its unique powers -- but the storytelling carefully but surely builds its tension, pulling viewers in with excellent craft. By the end, we may be left wanting more, but its eeriness and evocation of evil in the modern world will linger -- and we may never quite look at a snake in the same way again.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Hemlock -- who makes it the longest and scariest walk of Emily's life.\n\nThis horror short -- created by writer/director Edward Lyons and producer/co-writer Melissa Lyons -- has plenty of chills and thrills, constructed through uniformly excellent craft, with deft camerawork, beautifully lurid lighting and effective performances. Like many films of the genre, it's a showcase of craftsmanship, and luxuriates in building up tension and paying it off with great style and panache.\n\nIts set-up is classic horror territory -- a girl alone in an alleyway -- but it executes its mission in a way that's memorable and distinctive. The artistry has an exuberance and sense of brio, with a carnivalesque sense of theatricality and eccentricity that brings to mind the best work of Tim Burton, whether through its creature effects or its dark yet jaunty visual sensibility. This is a film that isn't afraid to really \"go for it,\" and with its flights of surreal fancy and baroque touches of horror -- not to mention its brash humor -- creates a genuine sense of fun and entertainment alongside its suspense.\n\nThe film remains grounded, however, in the emotional reality of its lead character. The writing excellently delineates Emily as a fully fleshed-out character and Alfred as a worthy nemesis, and the ensemble cast brings them to life with great skill, creating a sense of emotional intimacy and specificity that allows audiences to truly experience the story alongside them.\n\nThe two lead actors, Renaye Loryman and Tristan McKinnon, play well off one another, even though their performance styles are quite different. Alfred has the charisma and sense of danger evoked by rock stars and keenly relishes his power, while Emily is played with a naturalistic attunement to the emotional dilemma she's experiencing, each beat building up to a great and highly satisfying turning point for the character. Through Emily's battle with Alfred, she comes to realize that she isn't powerless and victimized as she thinks, and her ability to grow adds an emotional arc to an already wildly enjoyable ride.\n\n\"Alfred J. Hemlock\" is that rare distinctive horror short that not just pulls audiences in with its keen sense of storytelling, but also with vivid, memorable characters that feel real and relatable. Viewers will not only find pleasure in the film's sense of almost old-fashioned entertainment, but also enjoy their time in Alfred's funhouse of fright -- and maybe even come out of it like Emily with renewed purpose and strength.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Lead by a stern preacher, this community is strict, puritanical and willfully circumscribed.\n\nBut Ella, the preacher's daughter, has a secret. And when it comes out, its impact is explosive within such a small, quiet community, its reverberations unraveling the community in an unexpected way.\n\nDirector Dean Puckett's folkloric horror-thriller has its roots in a strand of British horror films of the 60s and 70s, locating its feeling of strangeness and uncanny dread within a seemingly idyllic countryside that is captured in gorgeous and lush 35mm cinematography both rich in color and austere in its framing.\n\nEven the camerawork seems to capture a sense of timeless nostalgia, with its almost old-fashioned push-ins and statically framed wide shots, which underscore the rigidity of the community it captures. The result is a ravishing visual experience that adds an elegant and incisive level of meaning to a film already rich with allegory.\n\nThe script itself is remarkably quiet, and with spare dialogue, subtle but effective performances and archetypal characters, the story feels very much like a folktale or fairy tale, exploring issues of sexuality and oppression. It's aided by quicksilver editing that moves the audiences through the twists and turns adeptly, though it offers ample opportunity for reflection and reverie.\n\nBut when the narrative hits its disturbing, repulsive twist, it takes on an almost surreal quality that feels somewhat like a Hieronymus Bosch painting, with its wide scale containing miniature details of human cruelty and punishment.\n\nThis short sits firmly in the horror category, but with its crystalline cinematography and its well-drawn atmosphere of both nostalgia and timelessness, it feels literary in scale and quality and begs for further exploration. Puckett is developing the film as a feature, which will give the story ample room to explore its powerful evocation of puritanism, seduction, violence and ideology. Juxtaposing almost voluptuously sensual images against a story of sexual repression, \"The Sermon\" is full of rich contrasts, provocative ideas and haunting moments that take viewers to a strangely uncanny time and place, all while illuminating parallels to our own moment in history.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

A mysterious Mr. Black arrives to choose a servant for his household, but despite warnings from her fellow inmate, she puts herself forward, literally, to be chosen.\n\nBut life on his remote farm isn't easy. Her new master is abrupt, strange and seems to harbor not-so-honorable intentions towards Louisa, and she's at his mercy in such an isolated setting. Her only solace is befriending an orphaned lamb on the farm. But when she unearths some grim truths hidden in the darkness, she realizes that her desperate grab for freedom may be the path to danger.\n\nWriter-director Heidi Lee Douglas's gothic thriller reads both as a richly vivid evocation of a rarely captured historical milieu and a perilous, suspenseful dark fairy tale that bears a resemblance to the infamous tale of Blackbeard.\n\nThe beautifully textured cinematography is rich in shadows and grit, emphasizing the dank, damp filth of Louisa's incarceration and the raw, primitive \"nowhere's land\" that surrounds her on the farm. Viewers get a visceral understanding how just how difficult life was in this undeveloped place, from the dirt on the walls to the thickets of forest and woods that Louisa is pulled through with her ominous new master.\n\nBut the excellent writing and editing never forget its primary task to pull viewers along, weaving in tension and suspense as Louisa's innate curiosity pulls her in deeper into Mr. Black's thorny knot of mysteries. He secretly watches her while she bathes and comes close to attacking her sexually, but the real mystery seems to be his warnings to Louisa to keep out of certain areas on the farm.\n\nLouisa, of course, can't help but investigate, and a vibrant, wily performance by actress Georgia Lucy makes such curiosity and rebellion an essential component of Louisa's vital pluck and resilience. Playing Louisa as a force of nature longing to break out into the larger world, Lucy brings an innate quality of fierceness and power to her characterization.\n\nPerformer James Grim plays against her as Mr. Black, and though he's clearly sinister, there are hints of a complex, tormented nature to make him more than just a typical villain. When the two leads have it out in their final confrontation, the world, characters and story have been so fully constructed that the ending is terrifying, compelling and beautifully cathartic.\n\n\"Little Lamb\" is both a chapter of distant history, and a terrifically executed thriller with dark, diabolical shadings. But it's also a story about how the weak and seemingly helpless find the resources and strength to pull themselves out of darkness. Louisa is above all else a fighter, with a strong spirit and a will to survive. And by the film's end, she will linger in the imagination with viewers wondering where she goes and what kind of life she'll make for herself.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Other than that, they don't know much more about their work, or their mysteriously tight-lipped -- and armed -- employer.\n\nBut eventually their curiosity -- and their growing fear -- prove irresistible. And when they open the box, what comes out is surprising, alluring -- and incredibly dangerous.\n\nWriter-director Patrick Mason's short straddles the horror and thriller genres, but what it traffics in is really the element of suspense, as well as the dangerous appeal of the unknown and the secret.\n\nUsing atmospheric cinematography, an ominous score and subtle but effective performances, the film expertly builds up tension, first around the situation of doing paid work for someone they don't know, and with seemingly questionable motives.\n\nThe central question, of course, is exactly what is in the box, and the film masterfully constructs the mystery of its contents. Little details -- a heavy silence, a shot of an item on the car dashboard, an unusual noise in the sound design -- offer clues for astute viewers.\n\nBut the film's real pleasures are found in the excellent execution of its craft. Its small details are judiciously parsed out by well-paced editing, which strike a great balance between taking time to notice the tiny moments of disquiet and curiosity of the labourers with keeping the suspense building. The film knows exactly where to put the camera to maximize both information and surprise, making each frame and shot count.\n\nThe result is a masterfully crafted and indelibly frightening horror short that offers a new take on Pandora's box, and creates its suspense with intelligence and great skill. \"Ayuda\" may not have convoluted twists and turns, but it illustrates how one of humanity's great assets -- our need to know and push at the boundaries of our knowledge -- is also our biggest weakness, often with disastrous consequence.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But despite his t-shirt, sneakers and voluble affability, he's not the typical sightseer. A fan of horror films, Merv is actually in search of the birthplace of his hero Boris Karloff, the iconic actor who portrayed Frankenstein's monster.\n\nThe last thing expects at such a historical venue is a rundown kebab shop, run by people who seemingly have no clue who Karloff is. But the intrepid Karloff devotee hasn't come this far not to see where his idol was born and lived, but what he discovers is not at all what he expects.\n\nJust in time for the 50th anniversary of Boris Karloff's death, director Robert Hackett, along with writer Mike Goldfarb, has crafted a sly, drily humorous horror short distinguished by its exemplary sense of craft and clever, sleight-of-hand storytelling prowess.\n\nWhile many films in the genre ratchet up a certain, suspense-filled craftsmanship based on building tension and exploiting narrative uncertainty (as well as many jump scares), this story begins in a quieter, almost naturalistic way, tracking Merv's arrival in England. He's clearly an eager, friendly American, wide-eyed and excited about an attraction that he's long anticipated, and the juxtaposition between him and his new environment is often observed with a wry, funny objectivity and luminously muted images, beautifully shot on 35mm.\n\nActor Mac McDonald plays Merv with great skill and subtlety. The role could easily become a caricature of a gauche American abroad, but both the writing and acting make clear the immense respect and reverent passion that Merv has for Karloff, which actually earns the audience's own affection and interest for Merv. Merv does have an almost down-home, charming na\u00efvet\u00e9 to his demeanor, but it's more due to how his deep and abiding interest in Karloff blinkers him, even as it tows him deeper into the film's central mystery.\n\nBy this point, \"Boris In the Forest\" shifts into elegantly crafted classical scary-movie mode, with an expertly crafted sequence full of unforgettable dread, chills and an ending that will make audiences squirm in their seat. But it arrives at its climax in such an unexpected, idiosyncratic way -- and with such a fully realized character -- that it feels like a fresh, unique and intelligent take on the genre.\n\nIt genuinely feels like Merv has wandered in from another film -- a quirky California indie, perhaps -- and realizes too late that he's found himself in one of the horror films he loves and adores so passionately, much to both his excitement and eventual dismay.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But a fight with her husband Reed threatens to derail her evening plans.\n\nSoon the disagreement escalates into something much more serious between Emma and her husband, leaving little time to lock Reed away before their little secrets get out.\n\nWriter-director Kyle Bogart's short falls neatly into the horror category, with the supernatural secret between husband and wife forming a crucial fulcrum in the plot, as well as the secret that binds them together.\n\nBut at its heart, it is an incisive, penetrating and painfully realistic portrait of a fraying marriage reaching a crisis point. Shot with a sense of muted realism with an eye for the mordant and macabre detail, the story is really a domestic drama that uses its horror elements to heighten and foreground conflict and emotion to great effect.\n\nThe actual horror is handled with great economy and precision, using strategies of suggestion and innuendo instead of explicit violence or gore, though the visuals have an uneasiness in their preoccupation with the everyday surreal.\n\nBut the real conflict and violence at the film's heart are emotional, as the story focuses on how partners in a marriage can chafe against one another, and how this pressure can cause them to act out in ways both overt and passive-aggressive. Excellent writing and performances show a certain psychological acuity that often isn't found in this genre, as the storytelling puts the focus both on Emma's stifling frustrations and the wearying yet constant pull of marital obligations.\n\nLead actors Liz Beckham and Jason Newman play the long-married couple with a believable sense of long-running history, one that runs the gamut from indifference, comfort, tenderness and irritation. The internal and external conflicts emerge from this complicated relationship and the gravity it exerts on both husband and wife, mining emotionally complex and decidedly mature territory.\n\nBy the time \"House of Straw\" escalates the tension and suspense into a memorable climax, it has laid out its narrative elements with great care and precision, and watching the puzzle pieces lock into place is both highly satisfying and genuinely thrilling in the way that only a genre film can deliver.\n\nBut \"House of Straw\" resonates well after its ending due to the unexpected depths it excavates within its characters. Through well-delineated characters and unexpectedly emotional intimacy we achieve with them as viewers, it offers a powerful snapshot of the complexities of marriage, partnership, duty and a fraught yet powerful love that binds people to one another -- and puts a new spin on the phrase \"for better or worse.\"\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Despite his estranged wife's protests, he has also taken their young son with them.\n\nAs night falls, the trip proceeds like countless others, with Duncan building a roaring fire, accompanied by Oscar as his son sleeps in the tent. But then Duncan looks out into the woods... and something else is looking back.\n\nWriter-director Chris Cronin's masterfully suspenseful horror short plays with the gap between what is seen and what is imagined, exploiting the power of the human mind to fill in the blanks with fear and terror. Instead of leaning on horrific spectacle or a tightly-wound plot, the storytelling doubles down on dread and foreboding to pull viewers along to memorable effect.\n\nThe considerable craftsmanship takes a pared-down approach, applying its elements with a methodical, measured sense of craft that's almost minimalist in execution. The film is remarkably quiet -- there isn't much dialogue at all -- and it's also quite dark, taking place entirely at night.\n\nThe plot is simple, but through deft editing, excellent sound design and an intelligent visual approach that understands the line between mystery and clarity, it uses its thread of story to patiently lay down the groundwork of Duncan's increasingly eerie isolation.\n\nAs a result, the pacing takes its time at first, exerting a slow burn to deepen its mystery and thicken its sense of apprehension, especially as the solitude seemingly starts to play tricks on Duncan's mind. The storytelling keeps its narrative arc compact and focused, but it elongates the moment by packing each small beat with the unknown and unseen, making for a quietly intense experience.\n\nWhen Oscar senses something out there in the darkness, he pursues it, being a dog with an irrepressible sense of curiosity. With the sound of his bell being the only alert we have of his presence, the dog's flight kickstarts the story's momentum, and like dominoes, the carefully constructed mystery starts to unravel, for better or for worse.\n\n\"Oscar's Bell\" doesn't take the shock-and-awe approach of many films of its genre, instead opting for disciplined and elegant craftsmanship to tell its tale. The film's take on horror is ultimately is more like a psychological thriller, with a deep understanding of how our minds will project our deepest fears into the maw of an unknown yet suggestive darkness.\n\nThough there's a deliciously creepy twist at the end, the chills and thrills linger in \"Oscar's Bell\" because it takes its time building up its central mystery -- therefore creating a blank space dark and deep enough to be filled with our most deep-seated dreads and anxieties, and our most primal fears.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Though she has Skype sessions with her therapist, she doesn't have much contact with anyone else.\n\nBut when she tries to hang up a piece of art on a wall, she discovers a hollow space behind it, her growing fascination with the hole in the wall reveals a terror living behind it, which threatens to consume her mind... and perhaps even more than that.\n\nWritten and directed by Janina Gavankar and Russo Schelling, this horror short blends elegantly disciplined craftsmanship and a unique and thoughtful take on the grotesque to explore the deep, dark psychological terrain of guilt, fear, depression and stasis.\n\nWhat marks the film as unique is its precise, cerebral visual approach. With its initial emphasis on distant high angles and skewed compositions that capture the main character scuttling around her home almost like a science experiment, it evokes a Kafkaesque alienation. The feel is remote and desolate, and the character portrayed strange and inscrutable.\n\nBut both the camera and storytelling begin to achieve an intense intimacy with its main character -- also played by Gavankar, who has starred in movies like The Way Back and TV series like The Morning Show -- once she discovers the hollowed-out wall. The visions and imaginings her discovery provokes -- as well as her sense of time and reality -- heighten and intensify, becoming more surreal and disturbing. But attuned viewers will also detect the deep, squeamish feelings at the core of the woman's visions: her primal urges, self-loathing and shame.\n\nMany of these are expressed through disturbing visions fixated on teeth, tongues, orifices and the flesh in general. But this isn't meant to be gross for grossness's sake: these motifs are deployed in service of the psychological, with a keen emotional intelligence. The symbols are woven together is strange and fascinating ways, escalating in an unforgettable final scene that is audacious in its scale and cathartic in its bravery.\n\nThough it's not a simple throwback, \"Stucco\" has more in common with horror classics of the past like Roman Polanski's Repulsion, which similarly explores how a disturbed young woman projects her innermost fears upon her environment. Yet the heroine of this short isn't the victim of her time, her circumstances or her society. Instead, she must barrel straight into her own internal heart of darkness. But though her willingness to confront her monster directly, she achieves something truly remarkable at the end: her freedom.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Now Jono haunts her constantly as she goes about her life, followed by his bloodstained body. She has learned to ignore him over the years, but his presence -- and his constant quips and needling remarks -- continually reminds her of the actions she wishes she could forget.\n\nBut one day at a diner, they run into another pair in the same situation: Large is constantly accompanied by his former lover Maria, who he murdered when he discovered her having an affair. Through the couple, Alex soon discovers a way to free herself from her dark bond to Jono -- but that route may take Alex down an even more perilous, possibly violent path.\n\nThis stylishly ominous horror short -- directed by Stefan Georgiou and written by Fred Armesto -- falls on the moodier, brooding spectrum of the genre, taking time to lay down its compelling atmospherics and the fascinating world before building up to a tense, thrilling finish.\n\nThe storytelling sets up a dystopian world, where the urban jungle is a cacophonous backdrop to isolation and alienation. Richly saturated, moody cinematography and painterly, surreal images also go a long way to establish feelings of uncanniness and dread, and there are also aspects of film noir in how it renders the world as a place where violence and corruption lurk in the shadows, waiting to come out.\n\nMore importantly, the writing and craftsmanship take the time to explore the strange, fascinating relationships and emotions that exist between the dead and the living. Rather than scaring or haunting in a traditional, monstrous way, the dead here remain very much themselves, except for their injuries and mutilation. They're able to think, reflect and talk to their killers. Their constant presence weighs down the living, often pulling them into anxiety, depression or anger.\n\nThis is, of course, a potent metaphor to explore how guilt and shame can twist someone's behavior and action to an extreme, and the range of performances in the film makes that metaphor come to life. Lead actor Olivia Hallinan has the difficult task of portraying an immobilizing depression, but her portrayal is realistic and compelling in showing the inner tug-of-war between guilt, fear and inaction.\n\nWhen Jono convinces Alex to free herself from their dysfunctional bond, Alex and the story lurch forward with momentum, and the story's twists and turns culminate in a powerful encounter -- though it's highly debatable whether or not Alex becomes truly free at its end.\n\n\"The Dead Ones\" pays an unusual amount of time on its world-building for a horror short, but that investment also makes it a more resonant, emotionally compelling entry into the genre.\n\nHorror is, of course, richly metaphorical in bringing to life the almost primal fears and tensions humans grapple with, and here, it looks at the corrosive, toxic ways we can be manipulated by the shame we don't own up to and make peace with. \"The Dead One\" vividly brings to life a toxic cycle where guilt fuels poor decisions, which only leads to more guilt -- and a darker downward spiral that adds a new spin on Sartre's assertion that \"hell is other people.\"\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But while her house is large and spacious and things seem okay, the adjustment is proving difficult, and she's feeling anxious lately.\n\nAs she goes about her day, she has startling imaginings of disasters and darkness. But as these intrusive thoughts get more disturbing, the line between reality and imagination becomes blurred.\n\nThis horror-drama short -- written by Lisa Cisneros and directed by Danny Rhodes -- is a painstakingly constructed portrait of one woman's descent into an increasingly severe post-partum anxiety and OCD, exploring how it can bleed into psychosis. Like many films in the horror genre, it raises chills and suspense with excellent editing and command of craft. But the horror here comes from watching a mother slowly become unhinged, and wondering just if or how she may break.\n\nThe film is almost minimal in many ways, with little dialogue and an almost abstract, cool and distant visual style is almost antiseptically gleaming. Kathleen's world seems cold, lonely and isolating, which does nothing to help her feelings. She lives in a large, comfortable home, but the way it is shot often turns the space into something strange, uncanny and alienating.\n\nWith such a crisp, clean execution, the film generates suspense by setting up the growing severity of Kathleen's state of mind. It constantly toggles between her dark imaginings and her reality, at first shifting jarringly between the two.\n\nLead actor Maura Kidwell balances the multiple layers of her role, playing a competent mother on the surface, a more unbalanced one in her visions, and also the inner flickers of shame she feels as she comes out of each fugue state, dismayed at what she's just imagined. But as the shifts become ever so much more seamless and subtle, until what seems real is revealed as not -- and alarmingly raises the question of when Kathleen will cross the line and turn her urges into action.\n\n\"Everything's Fine\" ends on an emotionally complex, disquieting note, one that seems like a happy ending but is not. The indeterminacy of it raises important questions and thoughts about motherhood, mental health and just how prevalent yet hidden post-partum adjustment disorders can be.\n\nIt's tempting to judge Kathleen harshly because we assume the love engendered by motherhood is so powerful and all-consuming that it can overcome anything. We also judge mothers harshly if they at all deviate from the \"good mother\" ideal -- and yet we question just why so many stay silent when they struggle with mental illness. The result of the intense fear of judgment is often a seemingly small storm of shame, suffering and silence -- one that can easily gain momentum and become something much larger and more foreboding when it's ignored or hidden.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

After a party with the cast and crew, the monster starts to believe he has a chance with the actress. But when he realizes just how the others perceive him, he reminds them just what he's capable of.\n\nWriter-director Bob Pipe's horror-comedy short focuses on the personal travails of a legitimate monster who's starring in a horror short, and while it deftly apes the atmospheric, slickly brooding look of modern horror with a sense of accomplished panache, the heart of the film is a love story that's sweetly hopeful... until it's not.\n\nThe film toggles from a film-within-a-film to a more naturalistic, muted romance, and each mode is visually distinctive, showcasing the versatility and excellence of the craftsmanship. Opening with a classic horror scene, it immediately grabs attention for its evocation of fear and suspense. But as the story unfolds, the love story takes over and proves even more compelling.\n\nThe monster connects both sections, playing a typical villain in the horror portion. But in actuality, he's actually a gentle soul, with a courtly demeanor and an innate politesse that harkens back to a more genteel age. The characterization is richly developed, starting with the writing, with its excellent ear for dialogue and steady pacing that allows us to experience the build-up of rapport and connection between the monster and his leading lady. With his kindness, gentlemanly manners, intelligence and sincerity, it's not hard to root for him to get the girl.\n\nWith such a sensitively developed romance, performances are key to developing sympathy, and actor Richard Glover's portrayal of the monster is one of the film's strengths. The almost old-fashioned tenor of his language rolls off his tongue easily, as do the shimmers of tender hope as he gains confidence. He also captures with subtlety how the monster has been cowed by the world, almost forgotten and discounted as time has moved forward. \n\nJust as the films are crasser, romance and relationships are cruder. And people are meaner than ever -- even to the monster, forgetting who exactly they're talking to. But the film's final sequence gloriously (and hilariously) reminds viewers of just why the monster is a legend -- and restores him to his rightful place in both horror and the world.\n\nLike the titular character himself, \"The Monster\" at first appearance seems to be straight horror, but it has an old-fashioned sense of romance, going back to the medieval sense of courtly love, where a knight pays homage to an idealized woman. Setting the knight as a beast or a monster also harkens back to romances like \"Cyrano de Bergerac,\" helping us see the heart behind the distorted appearance. But in the end, \"The Monster\" is also a satisfying entry in the horror genre, reminding us that a monster may have intellect, kindness, civility, culture and sensitivity, but he still has the powers that make him supernatural -- and God help us if we forget that.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They are supervised -- or perhaps guarded -- by a stern, irascible older headmistress, who even rules over the school phone. Within this stultifying environment, Genevieve wilts in an unsatisfying life, a spinster looking down the barrel of a lonely existence.\n\nOne day, Genevieve is spotted by a man named Nigel driving past the school, who hears her summoned over the intercom. He decides to call her, and they have a conversation that is strange, intriguing and sinister. Intrigued, she continues her telephone correspondence with mysterious Nigel, which becomes stranger and more oddly seductive with each contact. When he finally reveals his ultimate secret, their mutual attraction may lead to fatal consequences.\n\nWritten and directed by Peter Long, this moody, surreal short drama achieves an intriguingly sinister and hypnotic spell, much like the same one exerted by the enigmatic caller that captivates the mousy, lonely titular character.\n\nNigel's spell over Genevieve is cast by the almost narcotic cadence of his language and suggestive, insinuating thoughts, and the craftsmanship also achieves a similar opiate-like quality through its singular dialogue and darkly beguiling imagery, rendered in beautifully gloomy black-and-white cinematography.\n\nThe storytelling takes its time establishing its rules of engagement for the audience, slowly constructing Genevieve's uniquely cloistered, stultifying world and her sense of isolation. The visuals are reminiscent of Fellini with their luminous use of black and white and their mix of the darkly fantastical, and like Fellini, the film has a dreamlike feel. The strange phone calls Genevieve begins receiving from Nigel, however, hint at a bigger, more peculiar world for her, full of strange fixations and appetites that are off-putting. But in such a circumscribed world, Nigel's attention is also flattering. Actor Beth Buchanan captures with delicacy and understatement how Genevieve falls under Nigel's spell, and her arc also guides the narrative shift into a strange, odd love story -- one that will transport Genevieve outside of her milieu, with grisly consequences.\n\nReleased in 2000 and the winner of the Silver Lion for Best Short Film at Venice that year, \"A Telephone Call for Genevieve Snow\" has an elongation of rhythm and narrative that feels classic and almost old-fashioned -- a style before digitized filming and editing made the lightning-paced, effects-laden style we're now used to possible, perhaps. But that more languorous, sensuous rhythm is part of the spell cast by this retelling of the Red Riding Hood fairy tale. It explores the classic allure of darkness and deviance, a set of impulses that have always bedeviled humanity throughout its recorded history. In a world so limited by social convention and expectations, such impulses seem to persist through the crack of civilized society and pull at us with their siren call.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But she's coming of age -- and experiencing strange, surreal visions and premonitions -- just as a mysterious pandemic sweeps the world.\n\nAs the world devolves into panic and chaos, Maria starts to develop powers -- ones that unsettle her family. Maria must navigate increasingly dangerous circumstances in the world, just as the threat at home is beginning to creep into her life.\n\nStately in style, with stunning cinematography and beautifully composed images and camerawork, this dramatic fantasy-horror short from Ireland maximizes the power of cinematic art to create a haunting, captivating atmosphere, perfect for a metaphorical tale about an avenging goddess coming down to earth to wreak havoc.\n\nIts story unfurls with the logic and flow of a dream, with almost free-associative editing and a haunted, drifting sense of pacing, which reflect the inner life of its central character. Yet it also excels in portraying the larger canvas of a world falling apart at the seams, through well-calibrated hints in the storytelling and effectively deployed images of dystopia.\n\nMaria, like the viewer, is haunted by totem-like symbols and visions. In their strange and terrible beauty and savagery, they also reflect the encroachment of her autonomy and sovereignty, and her own fears and anxieties. The images themselves are often stunning in their depth of imagination and evocation of terror, and are rendered with an almost painterly sense of light and line that is both beautiful and eerie.\n\nActor Rayleen Kenny plays Maria with admirable restraint, navigating the line of a growing inner unease with the need to hide her experience, lest it draws even more trouble upon her. Yet her growing powers cannot be suppressed -- nor her anger and resentment -- and when she suffers a devastating betrayal, her powers are unleashed, enacting terrible revenge in the process.\n\nModern in look and feel but mythic in theme and emotion, \"Wrath\" takes its inspiration from the story of Badhbh, the goddess of war and destruction in Irish mythology. And like the crow that symbolizes her, the film has the power of a harbinger of doom or an ill omen, with images whose fearsome resonance is not so easily forgotten after the film ends. \n\nIn the myths, the Irish goddess of war also delivered a prophecy about the end of the world, an \"evil time\" rife with betrayal and deception. It's a mythic and metaphorical prediction, but \"Wrath\" suggest this path is not so far away from our modern, rational world: the more choices we make that refuse to respect the wholeness and sovereignty of human bodies and earthly nature, the more chaos and destruction we sow by our own hand.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Unable to figure out the title and artist of the track, he's now on the phone with the airline's customer services as he flips through records at a local shop.\n\nBut dealing with the endless round of holds, waits and transfers on the phone proves frustrating, putting Charles through a uniquely modern hell just to simply find the one song that brought him joy during a rough time in his life. His temper gets the best of him, but in picking up the pieces afterwards, he gets a rare moment of grace.\n\nDirector Alex Medina, along with co-writer Juan Pablo Daranas Molina, has fashioned a comic short that, like many great comedy shorts, is an expanded scene taken to hilariously logical extremes.\n\nWhat makes this short work is its total relatability, and its portrayal of the absolute absurdity of modern life. Very few people can't relate to the frustrations of dealing with customer service that seems designed to thwart and even enrage consumers, instead of making them feel listened and heard.\n\nBut while the film's situation is absurd, it's still grounded in very relatable and understandable human emotions, functioning as a witty, revealing study of anger and aggression.\n\nThe lead performance by Jordan Rennick is both underplayed and outrageous, but there's emotional truth in his portrayal on how we take the anger and helplessness we feel in one situation and turn it against someone in another entirely different but adjacent situation.\n\nBut by the film's end, Charles has a moment of self-realization and vulnerability, realizing his own part in escalating a situation. The simple, quiet way he takes accountability -- and the kindness he shows himself and others -- complete his arc in an emotionally satisfying way that feels well-earned and organic in a way that's sometimes rare in comedy shorts.\n\nIn this way, \"Customer Service\" is a wry, knowing object lesson in just how crazy modern life has become, and how we navigate tricky situations through acceptance, honesty and humor.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But then Jennifer got pregnant, and now she and Jack co-parent a little girl together.\n\nBut one day, Chris asks Jennifer to marry him, so they can make it official. But Jennifer drops a bombshell: Chris may not be the father of the daughter. And with no better options, she may move out of state with her daughter.\n\nDesperate to keep them nearby, Chris convinces Jennifer to find the real father and get a child support settlement that will allow them to stay. But getting the DNA of other men proves trickier than expected, propelling them on an odyssey that's equal parts comical and touching -- and just a tad gross! -- to find out just who the dad is.\n\nEmmy- and Golden Globe-winning \"Band of Brothers\" writer and producer Erik Bork makes his directing debut in this charming, heartfelt relationship dramedy that goes surprisingly deep -- and makes a few unexpected detours -- to look at just what bonds and connects families and loved ones together.\n\nAs expected, the writing is superlative, with an ear for wry, befuddled dialogue and a sensitivity to the real emotional dilemmas that the characters are grappling with. Balancing the emotional drama with the moments of comedy is a high-wire act, but the short does it well, whether it's in the tenor of the measured storytelling or the muted, warm visuals, which have an earthy, 70s feel that suits an almost shambolic narrative. Even the toilet humor of the film is on the muted side, and though it's played for laughs, it also is an important part of the plot.\n\nThe excellent performances of the two leads, played by actors Jack De Sena and Rome Shahanloo, also suit the understated approach, offering up flickers of genuine vulnerability, doubt and uncertainty that tempers the scatalogically-inclined turn the plot takes. Even when genuinely hilarious moments bubble up -- many of them courtesy of actor Anil Margsahayam as a lab technician -- we always are in touch with what's at stake for Chris and Jennifer, and especially Chris's drive to keep his family together.\n\n\"I Got This\" is on the longer side of a short film. But in taking its time, it allows viewers the space to invest in the story and develop a wry affection for the foibles and quirks of its characters. It also allows time for the film's emotional arc to unfold organically. In the shared quest to find the daughter's father, Chris and Jennifer realize that it takes more than DNA to make a parent and a partner. It takes a willingness to stand by one another during the challenges of life -- and allow the process of that shared experience to change each other as individuals and as partners.\n\nThe film ends with a discovery, a surprise and a bit of a cliffhanger -- but it also ends with a heartwarming conviction that no matter what happens, this will be a family full of respect, love and partnership.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Yet somehow it keeps making the rounds on the way up in development offices throughout Los Angeles.\n\nWhen one lowly script reader -- the bottom of the rung in Hollywood -- gets a hold of the script, he discovers why. Somehow, this script causes the death of anyone who passes on it.\n\nAnd now the eager script reader must choose whether to risk his career passing forward a piece of mediocre work to his demanding boss -- or risk his life and pass on what he knows is a sub-par piece of work.\n\nSlick, clever and with a glossy sheen, like much of Hollywood itself, this thriller comedy by writer-director Jason Kessler is a sharp, funny commentary on the high stakes of Hollywood, a place where getting your work in the hands of just the right person can be the difference between languishing in the ranks and rising to success.\n\nSelf-aware and satirical, the plot is like \"The Ring, but with a script,\" as one of the characters says in the short. And like many films about Hollywood, there's a zing and patter to the performances, dialogue and pacing that mirrors the snappy ethos and mores of the movie industry denizens that populate its world.\n\nThere's great fun in the characters' professional judgment of the script, which has the temerity to use the word \"suddenly\" too many times within the same paragraph. A goofy movie-within-a-movie reenactment of the script riffs on the cliches of Hollywood stories, but it also offers a tongue-in-cheek peek at why such cliches keep happening in the films that Hollywood produces.\n\nThe comedy is often delivered through its dialogue, harnessed via the wry, skeptical responses of the script reader's friend, who offers a running commentary on his position, choices and lack of success. It's clear that his own lack of confidence and risk-taking has held him back, but now he must decide what's easier to risk: his life or his career.\n\nWith its final plot point, \"Death by Script\" takes a cynical turn, offering a darkly comic reveal of the seething ambition lurking underneath the bright, amiable surfaces of Hollywood. Entertaining, fun and impeccably crafted, it's ultimately about an ambition so toxic that it turns a script into an instrument of death -- and gives new meaning to the phrase \"killing it\" as a euphemism for success.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The result is a film that induces smiles for its relatability, and aches at the heart because of how quickly it goes by.\n\n\"Orange Drive\" is a perfect encapsulation of the emotional intensity of a teenager's life, from the peaks of first love and solid friendship to the lows of disappointment of fights, breakups and the confusion of simply being human.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The family curse goes far back into history and weighs heavily on Darby Duncan when he goes to his cousin's funeral, where he falls in love with his cousin's widow.\n\nArabella initially rejects Darby, but then gives in as Darby's own 10,000th day approaches. Darby sweeps Arabella off her feet with wild adventures and romance, living life to the limit.\n\nBut as Darby\u2019s final days approach, things don\u2019t go as planned, and Darby has to reckon with just what it means to be alive.\n\nThis comedy mines a tone and atmosphere that\u2019s both deadpan and quirky, and fans of filmmakers like Wes Anderson will enjoy both its dry humor and emotional complexity. Its script is both philosophical and down-to-earth, anchored with performances that both work within the film\u2019s unique rhythms but remain heartfelt and sincere.\n\nIn the age of \"YOLO,\" \"Ten Thousand Days\" takes a wry, amusing look at what it really means to live life to the fullest -- and the answer is a lot more complicated and resonant that you\u2019d expect.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

A fantastic lead performance by Gary Richardson -- who is also a writer on SNL -- anchors the film, as he ironically demonstrates a rare charisma in a role about a man desperate for it.\n\nThere's also great showbiz send-ups, including a fake musical, as well as fantastic camerawork that is both polished and agile, keeping viewers apace with a well-timed story and jokes.\n\nBut what really works is the character-based storytelling, charting the arc of a man whose hubris proves to be his downfall. It's a tale as old as Greek theater, given fresh new life in this nimble production.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Now Uncle Trevor is set to avenge her, armed with love, guts and a samurai sword.\n\nWriter/director Patrick Muhlberger has fashioned a charming, endearing riff on the revenge tale, juxtaposed against a classic teen coming-of-age story, complete with awkward yearning and heightened feelings.\n\nBlending deft comedy with the polished look of a music video, the film is stuffed with lots of warm family moments, as well as a few off-color jokes and a good amount of blood and awkward dancing.\n\nThe buoyant pace of the musical elements of the film as well as the comedy keep the story bubbling along, and the dark elements are balanced with a hilarious sense of commitment that sometimes verges on the surreal. It's a tricky balance, but the result is a movie that is whimsical and heartwarming -- but with enough bite to keep things from getting too saccharine.\n\nWith this mix of elements -- as well as strong performances by the cast, who capture both the seriousness of the emotional situation as well as the absurdity of the drama -- \"Pop Music\" is a distinctive, memorable film with a strong visual identity and a universal emotional appeal.\n\nSeth Earnest composed the song, \"Give Me This Dance,\" for the film.

He's a dad who can't quite connect with his kid, and his marriage is floundering. He's thrown himself into his work to take his mind off his worries.\n\nBut he finds his routine stakeout interrupted by his sister Lottie, who's intent on improving her brother's life. She stages an intervention aimed at getting Chris out of his rut -- at the worst possible time.\n\nThis short dramedy is a small gem of self-deprecating yet sardonic British wit, driven by an excellent script and superb performances. The film shines for its dry, deadpan humor and sense of irony, but what makes it affecting and memorable is how deftly it captures familial relationships.\n\nChris and his sister Lottie's dynamic as siblings is recognizable to anyone who both loves and has been completely exasperated by a family member. When played out in the tight confines of a car, it makes for smart, emotionally perceptive comedy that's still rooted in family situations almost anyone can relate to.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Despite the mordant nature of his work, he's cheerful and efficient and finds a way to enjoy himself despite it all.\n\nBut on one seemingly routine day, he gets the surprise of his life: he uncovers the body of his idol, esteemed actor Alfred Molina. And now he has to perform his hero's autopsy.\n\nWriter-director Dominic Burgess's short dark comedy is full of expertly timed funny dialogue and action, thanks to its quicksilver script. The words and action combust together with a keen sense of rhythm, while the camerawork and overall direction creates richly hilarious contrasts, whether it's the bubbly pop song playing in the antiseptic austerity of the morgue or the punchy, colorful cinematography portraying this milieu of frank mortality.\n\nBut the great strength of the short are its performances, including by Burgess himself, an actor who has appeared in many television shows ranging from \"The Good Place\" to \"The Leftovers\" to \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D\". As  the title character in his short, he goes through the five stages of grief in one performance, even managing to take a selfie with his sadly deceased acting hero, fashion styling included.\n\nBut through it all, he knows he has to do his idol's final autopsy, but it's simply too difficult at first to perform it. Those feelings are played for real, and those moments are sincere. The film's exploration of the feelings we have towards celebrity -- and the grief we feel when they die -- are rooted in real life emotions.\n\nIt's not uncommon for many people to know more about their favorite musicians, actors and sports stars than they do about their family members. But the attachments we have to them -- or for any entertainer that has given us pleasure, entertainment or joy, however vicarious -- are very real, for Sam and for a world that puts out outpourings of remembrance and grief on social media within hours of the news. Through Sam's reactions, the film offers an absurdist take on this, but the longings we project onto celebrities are real.\n\nThough covering dark and emotional territory in a light, even buoyant way, \"Sam Did It\" is full of twists and silliness -- and of course Alfred Molina himself playing Alfred Molina. Its ending twist may be outlandish, but the last zing is also unforgettable in its irony, the final punchline in a well-executed (ahem) short comic gem.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The sofa transports Joe to the past, present and future, helping him connect the dots of his life -- and see where he's headed in the future.\n\nThe clever premise and nimble writing and performances -- including a winning lead role by Matt Jones from \"Mom\" and \"Breaking Bad\" and Charlene Amoia from \"American Reunion\" -- are the backbone of this unique high-concept take on the romantic comedy.\n\nUsing simple but judicious special effects and puppetry -- including the couch (voiced by Josh Haness) and built by master puppeteer Michelle Zamora, who has done work on \"Adult Swim\" and \"The Pee Wee Herman Show\" on Broadway -- director Matthew Richmond creates a world that is both quotidian and familiar but still hilariously offbeat. With warmth and humor, the film quickly wins over viewers to its central conceit.\n\n\"Loveseat\" is a fun, charming film about what it means to \"adult\" and come into your own -- and will make you look at home furnishings in an entirely new light.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But the problem may be more about their circumstances than about their essential compatibility.\n\nWriter-director Jason Headley's short comedy is essentially an extended scene of a couples' therapy session, in which two people confront the issues plaguing their relationship, speak to each other honestly and come back together on the same page.\n\nBut Headley's riff on the situation is both clever and perceptive, offering a fresh and unexpected twist that adds a hilarious, slightly darker and complicated take on the relationship comedy. The surprise upends a fundamental premise on the genre, opening up a whole new avenue of opportunity for laughs.\n\nThe short is buoyed by terrific performances by Dana Blasingame and Matt Jones, who audiences may recognize from shows like \"Breaking Bad.\" They play off each other with impeccable comic timing, using the sharp, witty dialogue to explore the tensions, misunderstandings and grievances that can accumulate in any relationship. They banter and bicker as their bewildered, bemused therapist watches, proving that no romantic relationship, no matter its original origins of passion, is immune from the doldrums of discontent.\n\nCombined with self-assured direction and editing, \"Don't Keep Your Love a Secret\" is a smart, ironic take on the romantic comedy that percolates along, engaging audiences with its smarts and playfulness. By the film's end, audiences will appreciate its flip on the typical script of the genre, as well as its insights into the foibles of modern romance.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The film's central performer, Mary Holland, hits both the comical and dramatic notes with power and ease, and she's able to render both the profound and petty concerns she grapples with in a relatable, sympathetic way.\n\nVisually, the short is an absolute treat, and each image of the film glows with a vibrant color palette, often shapeshifting with particularly clever camera choreography. The overall visual sensibility is an often madcap, fantastical exploration into both Katy's subjectivity and the way the cosmos can offer both crisis and comfort in the midst of a breakdown of meaning.\n\nKaty's maelstrom of emotions are charted by a mixture of a dynamic, inventive mix of special effects and camerawork, whose sweep and movement make full use of the single set the film is shot on. The camera moves with the grace of dance choreography, emphasizing both the character's discombobulation and her increasingly nebulous tether to reality. When she goes into full superhero mode, the elements all combines into a heightened climax that is hilarious, cosmic and full of despair all at once.\n\nLike his other equally inventive short \"Pop Music,\" Muhlberger use his singular visual sensibility to explore difficult emotional territory, giving voice and light to the hard, almost unanswerable questions we all face at some point in life. The film is beautifully reminiscent of French New Wave director Jacques Demy's own musicals, whose candy color palette and sweeping Hollywood-style camera explored the tensions between ordinary life and the yearning for more resonance. Here, it takes the visual tropes of both musicals and action films, but subverts them from their typical uses of awe,  escapism and \"entertainment.\" Instead, \"The Katy Universe\" uses cinematic spectacle and magic-making to spin, dazzle and deliver an audience into a deeper emotional journey, to both the inner reaches of the heart and the ends of the known universe.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

His small crew, led by tough-talking Guinness, are also reservists, who all have various reasons of joining, most of them having to do with money.\n\nWith his laidback attitude and his skepticism about violence, Bobby is at odds with his group, and he doesn't get a lot of respect from Officer Guinness, who embraces the military ethos wholeheartedly. But one weekend, the group receives an urgent distress call, and the \"weekend warriors\" are challenged to help protect Canada -- and confront the ultimate test of commitment.\n\nWriter-director Lyndon Casey's comedy short has flourishes of eccentricity strewn throughout its narrative that will delight fans of filmmakers like Wes Anderson and Hal Ashby, all of whom have built their careers on a blend of quirkiness and sincerity.\n\nThe writing is full of studied, witty patter that can swing from crass to droll to deadpan within the same scene with panache. The visual compositions have a certain subdued formalism that emphasizes the absurdism of the circumstances, and the score is dotted with grand flourishes that humorously offset the ragtag gang's lack of ability to leave behind self-interest in the face of certain self-sacrifice.\n\nWith its sophisticated control of tone and dialogue, this is a comedy of manners with absurdist and satirical overtones. The object of its satire isn't the military itself, but the difficulty of leaving behind the limited mindsets of comfort, ego, entitlement and protecting our own interests to put one's self wholeheartedly into a mission that may require sacrifice.\n\nPerformances in a film like this can be tricky, but here they three actors -- Lyndon Casey, Conor Casey and Mark Roeder -- often achieve a satisfying balance of gentle satire without being too broad. What works is that each character remains true to themselves: Bobby's blithe obliviousness and hipster skepticism makes it slow for him to really grasp what's happening, Roderboy is really just there to provide for his family and Guinness's macho bluster is revealed to be a lot of smoke hiding a core of wounded insecurity.\n\nClever, funny and gently ridiculous at times, \"Weekend Warriors\" is really a story about conviction in an age where a social media \"like\" or comment is the strongest action people can take to express their opinion. But with its surprisingly sincere (yet still very witty) ending, it's also about what helps us surmount our modern self-absorption to become part of a community. When the group's attitudes finally openly clash in a hilarious battle of words -- and are revealed for all their bluster and brokenness -- they are also unmasked, allowing characters to begrudingly understand one another. The understanding transforms their dynamic just enough, giving us hope for Canada's safety after all.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But director Christian Cerezo finds a striking balance between the ridiculous and the life-affirming, with sharp dialogue and performances that keep it grounded in real emotion.\n\nThe result is a fresh, offbeat take on the relationship comedy that still maintains a sense of sweetness -- and provides a unique perspective on what it means to be genuinely intimate with someone. Everyone brings issues, insecurities and self-doubt to a relationship, but it's only when we are brave enough to be real about them that true closeness and trust is built.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Dan says they didn't order the creme caramel, but Zoe tells him to take it. She urges him as he takes small bites of it. Then, he cuts into the ring.\n\nZoe is proposing to him.\n\nSuddenly, armed robbers burst in. The gunmen walk to their table and Zoe gives them everything in her purse and then her jewelry. Dan hands over his wallet, then pauses before tossing in the ring.\n\nThe robbers go to the other tables. Zoe asks why Dan gave them the ring when the gunmen didn't ask for it. Dan swears they said \"anneau,\" or \"ring\" in French. And Zoe asks to see the phrase book. She tells him \"bague\" means \"ring\" in French, not anneau. She calls him a liar.\n\nTo prove himself, Dan crawls over to a French man and asks how to to translate \"anneau.\" The man begins to take off his ring. Dan admits maybe the robber didn't say anneau.\n\nDan sees people crawling to safety and suggests they run away with the others. Zoe, still upset, says she doesn't need to run away everything. Dan tries to pull Zoe to safety, but knock over the champagne bucket instead.\n\nDan admits that he's scared. Zoe says she's terrified, too. But she thinks they'll be okay. That gives Dan comfort and he crawls over.\n\nOutside, the police arrive.\n\nDan tells Zoe he can't stand creme caramel and they share a laugh together. Dan thinks they'll be all right. Then, Dan proposes to Zoe without a ring. As they kiss, the police rush in and kill the robbers. The ring sits in front of them in a pool of blood.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The two main actors play off one another beautifully, bringing both moments of doubt and humor and making for a pleasure to watch.\n\nThe premise of the film may be compact and limited to a precise time and place, but \"The Hook\" is able to tease out the internal conflicts and tension that often come with being a man -- all while landing sharply drawn laughs.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But at his job, he meets Allie, beginning an office romance that proceeds through a heartwarming arc, until unexpected obstacles threaten their \"happily ever after.\"\n\nWritten and directed by Ben Callner, along with brother Adam Callner as producer, \"Adman\" is a clever comedy-romance that makes its mark through sheer ingenuity and smarts, breathing new life into a genre that is often riddled with cliches. The most immediately notable aspect of the short is its ingenuous narrative and stylistic conceit. The plot itself is a boy-meets-girl classic romance that hits all the milestones of a relationship: meeting, flirting, marriage, conflict and resolution.\n\nBut the story is structured through a series of fake ads that sell non-existent products. The emerging couple feature in almost each spot, and characters and settings repeat, creating cohesion even as the \"packaging\" and marketing around the story segments changes. The result is a cinematic experience that's funny, clever and highly entertaining, presenting the traditional arc of a relationship in a fresh, hilarious way.\n\nWhat's remarkable is that each \"ad\" works beautifully on their own, made with remarkably polished craftsmanship and panache, and many are even Super Bowl-worthy, with twists of fantastic humor and surprise. (The Callner brothers are accomplished commercial filmmakers, working on major campaigns that include Volkswagen, Verizon and GEICO.) The setup and punchline of each commercial are engaging, witty and often quite memorable, supported with versatile performances that fluidly adjust to each segment's demands and unified by a polished visual approach of heightened naturalism.\n\nBut each spot also forms a credible narrative block of the overarching, building arc and plays off one another in unique, interesting ways. A sexy, funny beer commercial serves as the first date for instance, but consummating the relationship segues into a decadently indulgent commercial for ice cream that guarantees you'll never look at a pint of the dessert in quite the same way again.\n\nThe love story at the heart is really quite simple, but the film is also a creative, fascinating experiment in the different visual languages that permeate our media-saturated lives. The language of advertisements are re-appropriated for the more typically immersive demands of narrative filmmaking, making for compelling and even provocative questions about how the tropes of commercialized storytelling both heighten, compress and sometimes trivialize the way we tell and live stories about our lives.\n\nThe film isn't an emotionally intimate experience with the couple -- and we never quite \"know\" the couple or experience their sorrows and joys alongside them in a conventionally cinematic way. But commercials are designed to tug at the heartstrings as well, and when Logan and Allie's story reaches its conclusion through a penultimate tearjerker, it's hard not to feel sadness -- though that feeling is complicated by telling a genuinely emotional story through a hyper-stylized format. Is it the form that's bringing tears to our eyes, or the story? But does it even matter, when the storytelling is this good?\n\nOn its most basic level, \"Adman\" is a well-crafted, witty piece of filmmaking that takes advantage of the heightened commercial form to amuse and entertain. The Callner brothers set up a website designed to look like a director's reel, where users can \"remix\" the story, see how each spot works on its own and experiment with their own juxtapositions. The entire project is offered in a spirit of great fun and terrific wit, while still posing fascinating questions of just how malleable visual storytelling is -- and by extension, the viewers that watch it.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As he goes about starting his day, he thinks about it while in the shower. It floats through his head at work. He hums it in line for coffee. He just can't get it out of his head.\n\nHe finally learns the name of the song -- \"Jupiter\" by 19th century English composer Gustav Holst -- which finally allows him to do a deep dive into Holst's background and catalog. But instead of exorcising the song from his head, it only escalates the intensity of this particular earworm, making life very uncomfortable for Will indeed.\n\nDirectors Ken Williams and Denis Fitzpatrick -- working off a script by Williams -- ingenuously explore the everyday scenario of getting a song stuck in your head in this witty comedy short. It's a situation that nearly everyone can relate to, but this story explores it to its whimsical yet logical extreme.\n\nTaking a muted, naturalistic approach in both the visuals and tone, the film begins with the relatable scene of Will starting his day with the song in his head. But even as his everyday life continues, the song continues to flutter at the edges of his consciousness, slowly intruding into his life. At first he gets a few puzzled looks for his constant humming from people around him. But soon it starts to interfere with his functioning, affecting even his relationship with long-suffering girlfriend Dee, who is bothered by his constant humming, even as they sleep.\n\nThe scenario could easily be played with a sense of frantic farce, but the film goes for a softer, more understated approach, tracking the gradual creep of slight madness within Will's head. Actor Sean T. O'Meallaigh plays Will with a nuance and precision that allows him to stand in for the ordinary everyman. Even his reactions to the constant music -- and eventually the voice of the composer talking to him -- are played for believability, grounding an increasingly outlandish scenario and keeping it relatable even as it escalates.\n\nSolid sound design and mixing is key to making the film work, both as a way to track Will's subjective state of mind but also for the entrance of the film's unseen character, the composer Gustav Holst himself. As Holst's composition weaves in and out of the film -- and playing off Will's reactions quite well -- it deftly transitions from a pleasant bit of orchestral score into an uncomfortably intrusive presence, forming a key obstacle in the storytelling and driving Will bonkers.\n\nThe humor of \"Gustav\" isn't in setting up a joke and paying it off with a punchline, but instead taking a tiny but relatable piece of the everyday human experience and making it super-sized in presence. Well-observed, slyly witty and down-to-earth, the short is an amusing, enjoyable excursion into one man's head -- and viewers may never quite hear music, much less Holst, in the same way again.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The wonderfully unique dialogue and performances add to this atmosphere of Americana-gone-wild, capturing both the quirkiness of the characters and their unique ways of expressing themselves.\n\nBut though their world may seem initially playful and even whimsical, it becomes clear as we get to know them that they are struggling in many ways. They are struggling to connect, to be heard and seen, and even to find a reason to stay alive. Despair and emotional pain isn't that far from the surface, and deft performances straddle the line between the mix of deadpan humor and genuine pathos that characterizes the film.\n\n\"Popeye the Pizza Man\" is ultimately about the importance of reaching out to one another, despite dealing with our own issues and struggles. Its ultimate handling of suicide as its subject matter may seem roundabout, but as the result of its careful buildup, it is also done with authentic emotion and heartfelt respect. Short films about suicide can often struggle with the weightiness of the subject with the compressed time frame, but this film earns its audience's intimacy with its characters and their emotional journeys. The result is a warmly compassionate postcard from small-town America about what it means to be \"there\" for someone, woven together with great skill, humor, and sincerity.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He accompanies her on a planespotting session but Wendy remains impervious to Sidd's affections.\n\nBut even that inattention doesn't deter Sidd, who decides Wendy is the woman of his dreams. But when he gets too close, Wendy pushes him away. Undeterred, Sidd forges ahead to win Wendy's affections, only to discover a secret that may challenge his romantically-tinged perception of his potential love.\n\nDirector Dan Castella, along with writer Christian Sandino-Taylor and producer Lewis Partovi, has crafted an offbeat short romance between two strange souls who bond over their eccentricities and oddities, overcoming their own reticence and wariness to intimacy in the process.\n\nStylishly shot with pops and daubs of color within drab countryside and corporatized airports and hotels, the story is a straightforward romance in structure -- two characters have a spark, encounter mostly internal obstacles to romance but come to a rapport that leads to the next stage of intimacy. But it's executed with great panache, an ear and eye for ironic wit and a rhythm that fizzles, pops and percolates like a great indie-pop song.\n\nIn its short 11-minute runtime, the film manages to juggle many distinctive formal elements. The stylish visuals bring to mind elements of early Paul Thomas Anderson and Wes Anderson, and like those filmmakers, the dialogue and performances can be both highly stylized and studied, though there is always the pull of difficult emotions underneath them. Actors Amit Shah and Monserrate Lombard, who play Sidd and Wendy respectively, find that balance between playful irony and sincere feeling, and carry off some wonderfully absurd dialogue with aplomb and tenderness.\n\nAll the elements come together with terrific brio, and the story knows just when to offer an unvarnished moment of vulnerability that pulls Sidd and viewers in with rawness. Wendy lets her guard down, and Sidd must decide whether or not he can love the real Wendy underneath the eccentric exterior.\n\nFunded by Film London and British Film Institute, \"To Wendy Who Kicked Me When I Said I Love You\" openly brandishes its quirk and spark, but underneath its offbeat flourishes, it is a sweet, charming love story about cherishing someone's oddball tendencies and recognizing that sometimes thorniness is a way of protecting one's self from judgment or shame. The final scene is almost hilariously operatic in laying out one's oddities and pain points for another to look at -- but such openness requires bravery to reveal, and tenderness to witness. With both on the table, two strange and lost souls can finally come together.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Wanting to keep up, Luca coerces his beautiful wife Anna into bringing another woman to his table, adding to his aura of allure and dominance.\n\nBut soon this triangle becomes even more complicated than Luca can manage, as the slim narrative of the advertisement becomes a complicated roundelay of seduction, manipulation and betrayal.\n\nWriter-director Nic Fforde, along with co-writer Giulia Watson, opens this deliciously subversive tale of power, privilege and decadence with a faithful rendition of a vintage TV ad for cigarettes. Cigarette TV ads are banned now in the U.S., but back in the 60s and 70s, these ads gussied up their outrageous chauvinism and lechery with the trappings of wealth and power. Visually it's no different here, and the re-creation of the vintage aesthetic is exquisitely done, seductive in its hazy, smoke-filled cinematography, meticulous set and costume design and hypnotic cocktail music.\n\nYet the writing also underlays a cheeky sense of satire underneath the visual glamour. The dialogue is all cliches of advertising slogans -- heightened, aspirational and unabashed in its will to power -- as are many of the performance tics, such as the smoldering looks, loaded silences and sighs of enjoyment.\n\nThe storytelling extends past satire, though, as it takes the mores of the world and characters to their logical extreme. Confined to this netherworld of fantasy, greed and power, they start to realize the consequences of their desires to consume, impress and dominate over others to prove themselves. Cliches of gesture and words take on new meaning and use, and the stereotypes portrayed -- the jealous wife, the seducer, the naif -- reveal flickers of humanity.\n\nThe acting of the entire cast excellently manages a delicate and difficult balancing act here, enacting both a dated commercial style of performance with both sincerity and self-awareness, and yet delineating precise moments of emotion and decision-making to sweep audiences along into what becomes a droll and delectable comeuppance.\n\n\"Ralph Ultra Styles\" in some ways resembles the video art of the 80s and 90s, which often took \"found footage\" of the past and re-edited it to recontextualize the unspoken societal rules encoded in its stories. And the heart of the project does use advertising's fantasies to question how ideals of power still operate in today's world. But the film is also highly entertaining in its sneaky yet sure-footed storytelling, with the type of wry, ironic humor that is a slow burn instead of a punchline hit.\n\nSumptuous, witty and well-crafted, this \"ultra-special\" short is both devilishly fun and smartly engaged in what it means to exist in this modern world -- one that is remade and resold to us in the form of fantasies that embody (or sometimes create) our deepest longings to \"make it ultra.\"\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Her cynicism prepares her to face her enemies, but she doesn't quite see the real threat emerging from the shadows.\n\nWritten and directed by Matteo Mosterts, this dark comedy combines fading visual grandeur with smartly stylish writing to achieve an arch, witty tone. It's not unlike if Wes Anderson grew up in Southern California watching Dynasty. \"Wally's Will\" as the same dry, almost deadpan tone that is perfectly suited to a story about the rich and the damned, but transplanted to the West Coast.\n\nThe film is anchored by a confident performance by Linda Gray, who starred as beleaguered wife Sue Ellen on legendary evening soap opera Dallas. Here, she plays the dotty, canny grande dame Wally with a innate elegance that sits over a layer of loneliness and despair.\n\nThe performance has a brittle wit, balancing the dark comedic demands of the writing with a genuine sense of pathos. It teeters on the edge of broad satire but never loses its balance, retaining an essential humanity that makes Wally a more subtle and human character than may initially appear on the surface.\n\nThat vulnerability makes Wally all the more alone, surrounded by a solidly realized world of Californian privilege and wealth. The settings and production design all speak to Wally's milieu, and once again balances stylization with a sense of realism.\n\nThere's also a warm, golden yet murky quality to the visuals that hint at both the world's decrepitness and its once gleaming opulence. A stylized, diorama-like quality reflects the artificiality of Wally's world, one that, in the end, leaves her despondent at just how alone she is -- and therefore vulnerable to the unlikeliest conspiracies.\n\n\"Wally's World\" is a dark comic romp, told with self-assured insouciance, whether it's in the brisk pacing of the storytelling or the mannered performances of the cast. Though there are undertones of tragedy and doom, the jazz-like rhythms keep the film buoyant and fizzy with cleverness, and set the film up with a delightful bite to its ending, adding to an piquante twist to this strong cocktail of a short.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Tensions between the two loudest friends -- Sheldon and Warren -- come to a head, as the lifelong group threatens to fall apart.\n\nWriter-director Eric Ian Goldberg's short comedy has its decidedly delightful quirks, both in the writing and the visuals, but it's also grounded in the very real pathos of being human. More specifically, it's about facing mortality and deciding just how you want to journey down the last stretch of road in the end.\n\nThese are heavy themes, but they're handled with great buoyancy, finesse and plenty of wisecracking, trash-talking banter, especially in the performances by veteran character actors Mark Blum and Richard Kline, who play a particularly irascible pair of friends.\n\nThey bring to life a script that bristles with sharp, character-specific dialogue and a sly eye for the ways that competition, ego and the irresistible need to be right can derail a conversation and even a long-term friendship.\n\nThere's also an understated flair in the visual sensibility, which blends the realism of an urbane Brooklyn comedy with the formal visual compositions that add a deadpan commentary to this tableau of old comrades and buddies.\n\nTerrifically paced and highly enjoyable, \"Fault\" is less interested in burrowing deeply into individual characters than capturing the dysfunctional group dynamic of classically grumpy old men with a wry, affectionate eye. But as the quartet adjusts to its smaller numbers, they soon realize that perhaps bygones should be bygones in the long run... because there's not much distance left to run, after all. It puts things in perspective, achieving an ending that is both poignant and endearing -- though not without a little vinegar in the mix.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She is attending her Nana's 100th birthday, but things go terribly wrong when it's revealed that Maia is the most controversial of things: a vegetarian. The news is enough to shock Nana into an early death.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, Maia struggles with feeling alienated from a family that doesn't seem to understand her -- and feels free to judge her choices openly to her face. Faced with being the permanent \"gringa\" outsider in the family, will she have to give up valued facets of her identity in order to be part of her family?\n\nWriter-director Jessica Mendez Siqueiros's warm yet astringent family dramedy has gallows humor, vibrant visual beauty and a conclusion that is equal parts heartwarming and mordant. Fitting for a film about food and family, the short is a visual feast, with bright, clear colors and a quirky compositional style that is reminiscent of Wes Anderson, with diorama-style wide shots and a formality in the framing.\n\nAnderson's influential style -- usually capturing rarefied worlds and socioeconomical strata -- is applied to a story about Chicana family life, giving a deadpan comedy to the narrative, as well as a strikingly heightened quality.\n\nStories about the \"other\" are often filmed in a \"gritty\" way, but seeing this dark comedy rendered with a vivid, precise formality lends the story the feel of a storybook fable, and a distance that trains a wry eye upon the values, assumptions and motivations of the character onscreen. The highly-aestheticized style also calls attention to the beautifully calibrated writing and the collective performances of the cast, which tread the line between farce and genuine emotion. Here, it emphasizes the idea of a family.\n\nAn Oscar qualifier as the best comedy short winner at Cinequest, \"Pozole\" takes a time-tested theme -- the connection between food and family bonds -- and gives it an intelligent, darkly funny spin. This isn't sentimental tourism, but instead a warm but biting window into a family balancing heritage and modernity.\n\nThe clash can lead to unexpected skirmishes, but though the film is a highly stylized comedy, it possesses nevertheless an authenticity that's rendered not through hand-held doc-style filmmaking, but through a strong, highly specific POV and an affectionate yet critically thoughtful honesty.\n\nQuirky in execution yet sturdy in its deeply loving -- yet no less fraught -- evocation of family life, this film is colorful, complicated and complex -- just like families everywhere.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

At the reading of the will, however, they discover a strange clause in Harold's legal document: he wants his body to be stuffed and kept on display in the palatial family residence. If the family doesn't agree to these terms, then they get none of their inheritance.\n\nThe omnipresence of Harold's body exerts a strange presence as the family grapples with their loss and their unresolved feelings for him. With his dead body as the home's latest \"furnishing,\" each family member comes to terms with Harold's presence in their life as they go through a strangely heightened process of grief.\n\nWriter-director Matt Kazman's short takes the visual grammar of a wealthy family drama, applies an artful, darkly humorous lens upon it and renders a surprisingly meditative and emotionally rich meditation on family, grief and legacy, all while keeping an eye on how the machinations of wealth can affect the dynamics of love and bonding.\n\nVisually, the film will read for many like a darker, more somber Wes Anderson or legendary Japanese director Yasuhiro Ozu, using formal, portrait-like visual compositions to emphasize the grand yet stilted tableaux the family exists within, whether it's the ornate family home or the sumptuous yet claustrophobic interiors.\n\nBoth luxurious and chilly, these images emphasize both the stifled atmosphere of the family as a whole, and the chilly formality in how its members relate to one another. To leaven the stiltedness, there's often a dark, deadpan humor in how the scenes are framed, using the vast spaces at the margin of images to hide ironic, humorous flourishes.\n\nThe impeccable craftsmanship and visuals emphasize a certain distance and formalism, the emotional territory mined by the film isn't played for dryness or irony. While there's a certain biting humor -- the kids say their father figurine looks like a \"rapist,\" for example -- there's also genuine grappling with mortality, grief and unresolved feelings and regrets.\n\nThere's a certain stylized quality to the cast's collective performance, with a deliberate and even mannerist quality to the rhythms of the dialogue and delivery. But there are also precise, specific moments where genuine flickers of regret, sadness and uncertainty shine through, and their muted quality adds to their underlying heartbreak.\n\nHarold's constant presence as a corpse reminds the family he left behind of how absent he was emotionally while he was alive, bringing up sadness and anger at the way Harold failed them as a father and husband, and the way he exerted control over them through his wealth, even in his death. It's this control that is ultimately his final legacy to his family, prompting a kind of unforgettable, hilarious and yet genuine cathartic release.\n\nDespite the initial polish and almost uncanny elegance of its approach to craft, \"Father Figurine\" isn't afraid to go into raw emotional territory -- and indeed, its formalism and dark humor may indeed make such uncomfortable feelings easier to tiptoe into, for its characters and for the audience.\n\nThe anger and regret Harold's family feels is muted by the film's formal demands, but it is palpable -- and it's not unlike what many people feel when a family member with whom they have serious baggage passes away. That baggage doesn't go away with their death, of course. Instead, it becomes part of the larger inheritance they leave behind, and part of the process of grief is accepting these complex feelings and allowing space for them to exist and express themselves.\n\nOnly then can those they left behind truly move forward, and find an odd sense of wholeness, within themselves and as a family.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

A Christmas \"orphan\" without a place to go for the holiday -- and stuck in an apartment with the power shut off and no running water anymore -- he gets an invite to one of his middle-aged student's home for Christmas dinner.\n\nBut Kurt doesn't realize what strange situation he's walked into. His student seems to have a drinking problem, and his marriage to his younger, attractive wife seems troubled. Throughout the evening, Kurt must figure out and then navigate a strange domestic situation -- and this is before the titular Christmas fish is prepared and eaten for dinner.\n\nWriter-director-lead actor Cole Stamm's understated dramedy in many ways takes a series of classic storytelling tropes -- a classic \"fish-out-of-water\" story about a \"stranger in a strange land\" -- but infuses them with a wry, intelligent tone and perspective.\n\nIts strengths as a film lay in its excellent writing, with a keen sense of character detail and an ear for the way that people dance around their truths and desires in conversation without every quite summoning the honesty to speak openly and fully. Stamm's sense of comedy seems to exploit the gaps between what's said and what's meant, making for many humorously awkward situations that play out in a quietly dry way.\n\nThe visuals, too, are equally low-key yet perceptive, favoring a naturalistic, muted color palette and very subtle camera movements that emphasize the strange interactions that Kurt finds himself in. The longer shots that the editing favors capture the way the uniformly excellent cast respond and strategize around one another, creating a cat-and-mouse game that resolves on a poignant, resolutely human moment.\n\nMany films use the holidays as a way to explore family bonds in a warm, big-hearted way. But \"The Christmas Fish\" resolutely avoids cheap emotion, though it's still interested in how people form communities, bonds and connections with one another. Instead of warm-and-fuzzy stories of sentiment and emotion, connections are made through longing and loneliness. The ending gestures at a kind of fellowship of human suffering, through a gentle acceptance of our flaws and needs and a willingness to share company and bake bread as we mutually stumble through life.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Deciding that his purpose is to make his king happy, the pinata enjoys the sights and sounds of life and especially the affection of his king -- only to discover that life is not what it initially seems.\r\n\r\nThis marvel of a dark existential comedy -- directed by David Bornstein and written by Ari Grabb -- masterfully balances a range of tones, mixing the existential questing of an inanimate object with an audience's sophisticated knowing of its true fate, adding to both the ironic comedy and the eventual heartbreak.\r\n\r\nThe elegantly expressive cinematography and camerawork add lyricism to the images and communicates both the POV of how the pinata sees the world, as well as its place in it. The over-the-top dramatic score offsets everything with a knowing wink of melodrama that nevertheless remains proportional to the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nExcellent writing manages the trick of explores the gap between the pinata's knowledge of the world with the audience's knowledge of his fate. Sometimes this gap is mined for whimsy and humor, especially since the pinata's \"voice\" is so serious and philosophical in nature, making for brilliant and hilarious juxtapositions.\r\n\r\nActor Adrian Gomez gives a richly expressive voice performance as the pinata, injecting a sense of gravitas and wonderment into the pinata's thoughts. Yet it is never played for cheap, silly laughs: the pinata's marvel at the world, his love for his \"king,\" and his hostility towards the king's \"servant\" is always sincere.\r\n\r\nAs he faces his fate, the voice, writing and filmmaking in \"A King's Betrayal\" all intertwine to generate a horrifying, poignant sense of despair at what awaits the pinata, and the devastating conclusions he draws about life's inherent difficulties, unfairness and the sheer suffering of it all. \"Life is just cruel\" may be the final lesson of the film, played for both jokes and reality -- and making for a surprisingly heartbreaking, emotionally rich storytelling experience.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

His routine is static and isolated, and his only real activity is watching TV, particularly a channel tuned to one thing: clips of sunsets on beaches.\n\nBut then Robert sees something disturbing on the television, and believes he may be the only witness to this event. He tries to report it to the authorities, which finally pulls him into the outside world... and propels him into a strange netherworld that unlocks the reason for his stasis in the first place.\n\nWriter-director Matthew Kinahan, along with co-writer Ben O'Neil, has crafted a disquieting, oddly hypnotic sci-fi short that uses its uncanny sense of mystery and a sneaky sense of momentum to create both an alternate reality and a haunting meditation on alienation, depression and grief.\n\nThe film begins by sculpting Robert's isolated world, using spooky lighting and offbeat compositions to create a subtle yet effective sense of being off-balance. These evocative visuals work in tandem with stunning sound design, which adds to the uneasiness of the film's world. Often certain elements of the ambient sound -- like a clicking of a clock or the static of a TV -- are mixed at disproportionate levels,  keeping viewers off-balance in an almost subconscious way. There's an effective, often ironic score weaving throughout as well, punctuating certain key moments of the story.\n\nThe storytelling itself takes its time to unravel itself, but once Robert makes the decision to leave his house and pursue his own investigation, the film opens up as well, picking up pace and tension and using its momentum to veer off into unexpected yet satisfyingly odd directions. By the time Robert encounters the film's endgame, the story reveals a richly imagined world lurking underneath its placid, almost soporific surfaces -- one that spins Robert into an entirely unexpected direction, and a collision with his innermost emotions.\n\nLike films from David Lynch and David Cronenberg, \"The Sunset Channel\" takes the strategy of exploring a seemingly peaceable yet static surface and digging underneath it to reveal a darker, sinister underbelly. But rather than take things into a surreal direction, the story goes deeper into Robert's psyche, revealing the persistent undertow of grief and its resulting depression and lingering sorrow.\n\nWhile perhaps the story lets go of the strange tangle of conspiracy too soon -- it's hard not to want more as viewers -- the final sounds and images of \"The Sunset Channel\" are fittingly melancholy and elegiac. The central \"mystery\" of the film's plot is solved, albeit very subtly, but the strangely heartbreaking ending shows that no reason or explanation can be imposed on a deep, abiding grief. Instead, it is much like a tide: it moves in a slow, powerful and inexorable rhythm of its own, and while it may recede, it never entirely disappears.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They're trying to conceive a baby (with the help of a very frank app) but realize their problem is deeper: the spark in their marriage has gone out.\n\nLooking to boost the passion in their marriage, they decide to venture into the wild, woolly world of therapeutic psychedelics with the help of a \"spiritual crisis center\" and an alternative therapist named Ariel, played by Bamford with equal parts \"purple aura\" and corporate aplomb.\n\nThe couple then heads out to the Californian desert to trip their way into improving their connection to one another. But when they drop a dose that is much, much stronger than usual, they're in for a wild ride -- one that takes them to deep places in both their marriage and psyches.\n\nWritten and directed by Scott Brown with co-writer Zack Gold, this short is as wild and zany as its title promises, tripping between timeframes, dimensions and visions with a surehanded sense of craft and a deft balance of tone. Visually, it's as exuberant, Californian and colorful as a 60s acid trip, with a polish and sheen that is entirely contemporary, and the first part of the film matches this aesthetic with its pacing and editing, veering from one vision to another to replicate the psychedelic experience.\n\nBut underneath the groovy stylings, the writing and storytelling go to genuinely deep and vulnerable places. Of course, there are fantastic one-line zingers and terrific witty banter woven throughout. But the dialogue is anchored to a  rich emotional journey, which is slowly but surely woven into the goofiness.\n\nIt starts with a hilarious sequence featuring a shining orb of light with the voice of Larry King, who prods the pair to look into their unconfronted fears and anxieties, both with themselves and one another. Soon they're whisked off to another vision and realize that they both even saw the same divorce attorney, played by a slick, gleefully snarky Paul Scheer.\n\nAs Debbie and Doug, actors Angela Gulner and Zack Gold go to genuinely emotional and vulnerable places as they confront their fears and worst imaginings and give voice to them to one another. With this authenticity, it's hard as viewers not to root for them and invest in their journeys as characters, even as they hit their darkest points of self-loathing and shame. But they soon learn to confront themselves and find their way back to one another -- also with the help of a little psychedelic assistance and some far-out visions.\n\n\"Debbie and Doug Drop Acid In the Desert\" is unabashedly fun, contemporary and entertaining in its wild dive into the world of micro-dosing, but what makes it rare and unique among comedy shorts is its emotional openness and intelligence. Funny, sincere and empathetic, it offers up with a resonant and universal message of acceptance and loving-kindness, both in self and with one another. The destination is ultimately wisdom and self-love, though some will have a little more help -- and a woozier, crazier journey -- in getting there.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Both husband and wife come and go, managing to avoid one another at the house.\n\nBut when Harry eats a bowl of plums that Abby clearly wants to be saved, it sets off a domestic skirmish that escalates into a full-fledged war involving destruction of property, infidelity and eventually... murder.\n\nWriter-director Monique Sorgen's dark comedy short has a simple narrative and premise, but it's not a typical story, though the plot about the final dissolution of a marriage is packed with dramatic action and extreme choices.\n\nInstead, like the famous William Carlos Williams poem \"This Is Just to Say\" that it both satirizes and draws inspiration from, it functions much like a work of poetry -- although one with sting and irony. Each beat of the story is much like a line of a poem, packing an immense amount of craft and consideration within a short yet powerful movement and taking a leap in pushing the story and meaning forward.\n\nThe result is a crisply biting, stylized film that succeeds with an accomplished sense of craft, starting with the golden-hued yet lurid cinematography. The editing, too, keeps things moving along. The rhythm isn't set by character motivation or realization, but by the torrent of anger, retaliation and revenge that the husband-wife pair spark.\n\nAn ironically whimsical score also adds to the musicality of the film, and the sound is punctuated by the constant whines and entreaties of the live-in father, played by acclaimed character actor and comedian M. Emmet Walsh. His irascible, sometimes pathetic presence lurks underneath the growing battle between Harry and Abby, like a buzzing insect that won't go away -- until one of them reaches an inevitable but still shocking breaking point.\n\nMasterfully crafted with a stinger of an ending, \"Sorry, Not Sorry\" is a neat yet cutting portrayal of passive-aggression and a darkly comic exploration of what happens when resentments build in any marriage and how that aggression can come out. Though its dark comedy stylings push the action to the extremes of human behavior -- and people would like to believe they're more civilized and well-behaved overall -- the impulses towards revenge and fury are still highly relatable.\n\nLike many dark comedies, \"Sorry, Not Sorry\" allows those impulses a playground for expression and an arena to wreak havoc in, in an inventive way. Its brutal honesty, married with a considerable command of craft and a quirky sensibility, may ruffle more genteel sensibilities. But many others will relate to its icky, squeamish truth about domestic life that underlies it and chuckle uneasily in recognition.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The great irony, though, is that he just can't fall asleep once he settles in. The setting is too strange, the machines they've hooked him up to are too uncomfortable and it's odd being in a new, unfamiliar place in the middle of the night.\n\nTim then enlists the help of the overnight technician -- his only human companion during the session -- to help him acclimate to the place and fall asleep. And amidst the strange setting and the nocturnal timeframe, the two make an odd but genuine connection.\n\nWriter-director Matt Porter's endearingly offbeat dramedy is essentially a slice-of-life narrative, dropping two disparate souls into a rarefied setting and situation and watching them bumble their way into a moment of friendship. Through a masterful yet deceptively simple command of craft and a compassionate eye and ear for the nuances of human neediness and vulnerability, it achieves a unique and captivating tone: it feels very much like an off-kilter, isolated yet oddly vivid incident in the middle of the night, where time and logic work just slightly different than during the day, and there is a patina of the unreal over everything that seems almost fable-like.\n\nDeft, pitch-perfect and affectionately ironic writing forms the bedrock of the narrative, building with wit and economy two ordinary yet utterly individual characters. These characters exist in a skillfully evoked netherworld of urban quiet and isolation, and the images of empty hallways and somehow sleepy-seeming buildings have a spooky, gentle magic to them that captures the melancholy and mystery of deep night.\n\nTim, played by improv star Chris Gethard, is a knot of mannerisms, worries and anxieties, but he is also more than just \"quirky.\" Though we don't know much about him outside of the film's scope, his fears and stresses are genuine, and his distress at being unable to sleep is both childish yet relatable. His technician foil, played with droll stoicism by Zack Cherry, plays off him with equal parts resignation and slight annoyance. But when the technician finally hears Tim out and meets him halfway, the result is something both beautifully simple and magically rare: a moment of \"being there\" for someone when they need comfort and just a little help.\n\n\"Nighty Night\" could be called modest and unassuming, and there is a kind of observational quality in its stillness and quiet. And with its lack of twists, shocks, high concepts, gimmicks, one-line zingers or relentless witty banter, its sense of humor is firmly on the character-based side, making it one of the subtler entrants in its genre.\n\nBut that doesn't dull the power of its warmth or sweetness. By keeping its focus on the oddly ordinary, \"Nighty Night\" somehow extends the spirit of its generosity and good humor to anyone else who is oddly ordinary -- which, of course, is all of us. And all of us may need a moment when we simply need someone to be there as a kind witness to our struggles -- as major or minor as they may be. When those moments happen, they may be fleeting or temporary, but they are no less incandescent.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

The pair haven't spent a lot of time together, but Lawrence wants to make it up to Rhys... by killing a calf and eating it for dinner.\n\nRhys tries to go along with his father's idea of family bonding, but his father's new partner Scarlett -- who says Rhys has a \"murky aura\" -- doesn't make things any easier. And once the bonding exercise goes awry, certain issues come to a head -- and clear the space to forge a new bond.\n\nTold with an understated sense of absurdity and an ironic eye for the foibles of human relationships, this short dramedy by writer-director Bryn Chainey is about a family finding its equilibrium, as a father and son try to bridge the gulf between them.\n\nShot in a naturalistic style that captures this isolated corner of Australia, the strength of the film lies in its writing, which possesses both dry wit and an understanding of the central emotional dilemma that pulls the story forward. Its humor is based more on the absurdities of human behavior and the eccentricities of character, as well as the odd choices that people make... such as a father thinking that killing a calf for dinner would make for a good family memory.\n\nWith this humanistic, character-centered approach to comedy, the ensemble of performances in the film always have their pulse on emotional truth, while still hitting their comedic beats. Young actor Nicholas Bakopoulos-Cooke captures the put-upon nature of an archetypal teenager, putting up with ineffectual and often hypocritical grown-up behavior, while as his father actor Steve Rodgers possesses an amiability and eager-to-please quality that is both sweet and passive. It's easy to see how much Lawrence loves his son, and also why Rhys is so frustrated with him.\n\nAs his girlfriend Scarlett, actress Sacha Horler almost runs away with the film with a tough, almost satirical riff on the New Age \"spiritual\" type -- one who also has no compunction about the practicalities of bleeding out a calf. (Points, too, for capturing a terrific animal performance without over-milking it.)\n\nWhen Scarlett barrels ahead with the increasingly farcical charade of this particular male bonding exercise, Rhys is pushed to the edge, in a climax that has a hilarious yet bittersweet domino effect on everyone's lives.\n\n\"Kill Your Dinner\" almost verges on farce near its end, but it never quite topples over into it, thanks to pitch-perfect writing and performances. Its emotional conflicts are very real and very relatable, but the storytelling carries this baggage lightly. As the main characters drive off into the distance at the end, the story earns a funny, endearing poignancy, thanks to its affection for the contradictions of human beings -- and its recognition that many of our stumbles and falls are a result of our best intentions.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She's also busy: not just with her job as a history teacher, but with classes and workshops, all designed to make her happier or better in some way.\n\nNone of it seems to be clicking, however -- she's still the same old Marcy at her core, going about her routine and work without much joy. So Marcy does something out of the ordinary: she signs up for a \"50 Shades of Grey\" sort of class.\n\nThe lessons prove unexpectedly practical and fulfilling, and when Marcy meets a younger man online, she's ready to put her new knowledge and growing confidence to the test.\n\nWriter-director Julia Kennelly's dramedy is about finding joy, meaning and purpose in the most unlikely of avenues. In the same way that viewers will find a surprisingly rich and heartwarming character portrait within the premise, Marcy discovers an unexpected source of hope and personal freedom in the workshop.\n\nMany stories about risque topics mine the milieu for shock or broad comedy, but what works here is the film's elegantly restrained directing and its almost prosaic, workaday presentation of its supposedly shocking subject. It's presented as part of the continuum of self-improvement options that Marcy cycles through, full of practical tips and exhortations of self-love and positivity. The storytelling has an eye for the wry, ironic detail and a warmly affectionate take on the absurdities of human behavior, and the patient, observational directing takes pleasure in tucking away moments on wit and humor in the margins of the frame and story, like in a wide shot that includes a kneeling submissive as a helpful human footstool during the workshop.\n\nThe spare, almost minimalist writing and pacing allow for a spaciousness in detailing Marcy's routine and frustrations. It also allows for lead actress Rachel Dratch to truly shine in a deeply resonant performance. Those who know Dratch from her broad comedic work on \"Saturday Night Live\" and feature films will find her work here richly grounded and endearing in both its vulnerability and humor. She hits the notes of vague dissatisfaction and emptiness at the character's beginning with depth and relatability, which makes her blossoming self-empowerment all the more wonderful to witness, especially when she connects with someone who will appreciate her newfound confidence.\n\n\"Marcy Learns Something New\" rewards its viewers with a fantastic ending scene that is heartwarming in its tenderness, empathy and emotionally generous humor. (They just might also learn some fascinating trivia about U.S. presidents in the process as well.) The ending is emblematic of the film's adventurous, big-hearted spirit and its ultimate belief in the resilience of human beings. No matter where we are in life, we have the ability to grow and learn -- and to find hope, connection and healing, even in the most unexpected of places.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Shpall.\n\nTHE BEST OF OMELETO\n\u00bb Celebrities on Omeleto: http://omele.to/celebrities\n\u00bb Best of Omeleto: http://omele.to/best\n\u00bb Millions on Omeleto: http://omele.to/millions\n\nOMELETO ON SOCIAL\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/omeletocom\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/omeletocom\nReddit: http://reddit.com/r/omeleto\n\nJon lives in a world where physical intimacy of any sort can lead to grotesque physical transformation, thanks to a virus that hijacks romantic desire.\n\nBut amidst this world, Jon is lonely and decides to risk his life for human connection, especially when he meets Maya, the only match he's made on his dating app. But things with Maya start to go wrong even before they officially meet, as the virus starts to wreak havoc on Jon's body.\n\nThis dystopian sci-fi romance -- directed by J.J. Shpall and written by Shpall and Eric Brewster -- takes a hypothetical question as a jumping point: what if there was a world where romantic love just couldn't exist? And is love worth the pain and agony it can spark within us when it doesn't work?\n\nFrom there, the narrative travels to unexpected, unusual places, as it explores the fears and longings humans experience when it comes to the search for romantic connection. The tone is both quirky and melancholic, a mix also encapsulated by its visual approach, which is shadowy, yet with an antiseptic sheen that marks many modern sci-fi films. There is a studied distance in the visual compositions of the film, emphasizing a world where people keep one another at arms' length.\n\nThe storytelling builds a somber world grounded in dystopian vision, yet within this frame, characters still awkwardly bumble, freak out and overthink as they put themselves on the line for love. The collision of these emotions with this eccentrically conceived world is both ironically funny and thought-provoking, but the film has a steadiness that keeps the focus on human emotions and keeps it from veering into farce.\n\nMany viewers will recognize much of the short's excellent cast, from \"Silicon Valley\" actor Josh Brener to Lauren Lapkus (from \"Orange Is the New Black\") to even Larry Hankin (known to many \"Friends\" fans as the downstairs neighbor Mr. Heckles). Collectively they're able to achieve a detached understatement in their performances that suits the film's tone, but they keep their pulse always on the genuine emotions of longing and loneliness that fuel the characters' arcs. All of these feelings keep the film emotionally grounded, and endow it with poignancy and resonance, especially as Jon finally goes on his much-longed-for date and achieves a connection -- though not quite in the way he expected.\n\n\"Date Nite\" was conceived of and made before COVID-19, but its release uncannily echoes the anxieties around physical contact, as well as the diffuse yet pervasive loneliness that happens with prolonged isolation. As a result, it may just be the first romantic comedy in the era of social distancing, and a line of dialogue like \"You are not alone in your aloneness\" can't help but take on new meaning.\n\nBut even before these times, \"Date Nite\" captures the growing emotional distance between people and within themselves, whether it's via the perfunctoriness of a job or a certain flatness in connecting over an app instead of real life. In this gaping, arid space, it's easy for us to build expectations and ideas, only for real life to puncture them with imperfection. The only remedy may be a willingness to be brave about our vulnerabilities and longings, even just to ourselves. In risking our hearts for love and connection, we may go out on a limb (and even lose it) -- but we may gain the only thing that bridges the distance.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

A consummate professional, he wants to fix his mistakes, not just for his reputation but for his own pride.\n\nBut things go awry in the middle of his attempt to fix everything, and in the worst place possible: the middle of the desert. When his car breaks down, the only people around who can lend a hand are a group of \"bro-y\" YouTubers called the DGAF Bros.\n\nMuch to the befuddlement of the hitman, the DGAF crew turn the occasion into a video for their channel. As much as the hitman tried to take control of the situation, the YouTubers' obnoxiousness proved to be more formidable an obstacle than Sergey could have imagined -- and ultimately endangers the mission.\n\nWritten by Nick Vitale and directed by Peter Mackie, this short possesses a very Tarantino-like mix of action, thriller and comedy, blending sharp and stylish high-stakes action sequences with a particular and goofy YouTube subculture, to humorous effect.\n\nIt's almost as if two very different types of genres and sensibilities collide into one film, unified by stylish, sleek camerawork and cinematography. Though the characters and action can be gleefully anarchic and out of control, the craftsmanship is impeccable and precise.\n\nBoth genres -- action-thriller and broad comedy -- are big in terms of movement impact, but they're balanced with a smart, engaging script and attendant editing that demonstrates a deft control of structure and pacing and takes advantage of the disparate genres and exploits them for great humor.\n\nIn many ways, the two strands of the film explore two different kinds of manhood, one classic and almost old-fashioned and the other with a new contemporary resonance and prominence, thanks to new social and streaming media. There's the strong, silent, hard-boiled and macho stereotype of Sergey, played with a consistent restraint by actor Yorgos Karamihos, and then there's the energetic, goofy Peter Pan-like manchild, embodied by actors Nick Mutuma and Hudson Long. Watching them try to make sense of one another, much less work together, is hilarious -- until the true stakes of the situation are revealed to all, to knuckle-biting effect.\n\n\"Sergey's Fortune\" is engaging and fun, and though it takes a little time to set up its titular character's dilemma and world, the pacing and plot pick up and then each event drops with the momentum of dominoes falling. Its cultural juxtapositions feel both fresh and classic and beg for a deeper creative exploration that would perfect for a feature-length story. It's escapist, stylish and perfect popcorn entertainment that's smart, subversive and a great cinematic ride.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

In an attempt to spice things up and put some spark back into their relationship, they decide to get busy in their car one Saturday morning.\n\nOf course, making the fantasy happen isn't without its obstacles. It's not comfortable, for one, and then there's the possibility of being interrupted by the postman.\n\nBut the biggest wrinkle may actually be each other, as what was supposed to be a fun little tryst takes an unexpected turn.\n\nWriter-director Phil Lowe's sturdy short dramedy has a premise that's ripe for creative exploration and depending on the sensibility of the team involved, it can skew towards both comedy and drama. Here, the film has it both ways, mining the awkwardness of the situation's foibles that arise before it takes a surprisingly sincere and honest turn into the deep layers of history and feelings that have built up between the couple.\n\nThe film rests on a solid foundation of excellent writing, finding humor in puncturing youthful fantasies of sex with the mundane concerns and anxieties of middle age. Essentially a two-hander between two actors whose arc is carried via richly witty yet honest dialogue, it aided by briskly paced editing and a mellow, warm look that's welcoming and inviting into this couple's world.\n\nActors Janie Dee and James Lailey play the couple with a terrific rapport, with both a deep sense of familiarity and affection -- and a few irritations and worries. They deliver the script's zingers with aplomb, but always with a sense of the emotions underlying the quips, barbs and witticisms. As they delve into deeper emotional territory, the conversation between the pair gets a little thornier and messier, but with a shared sense of caring and honesty, they turn a corner... without even leaving the driveway.\n\n\"The Driving Seat\" has a constrained scale in terms of its narrative and production scope that's typical of two-handers, but it offers a rarity in film: a truly grown-up, humane portrait of mature love and marriage that balances both the frustrations of such a long-term bond with the compelling love and acceptance that comes from knowing someone so well.\n\nBoth Jane and Martin discover that it's not just sex that brings the spark back, but a willingness to share, listen and be vulnerable and authentic. In other words, \"The Driving Seat\" is a lovely little vignette of intimacy in action -- not just physical intimacy, but the emotional kind built on openness, honesty, humor and acceptance.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But then within this stylish fantasy, it places a delightfully loopy roundelay of confusion and misunderstandings that expose the gap between romantic illusion and emotional reality.\n\nBuilt on a tightly structured script and direction and pacing that keeps the proceedings buoyant and engaging, the story blends self-deprecating British humor with a classic screwball rhythm that's reminiscent of the classic comedies of the 30s and 40s, which provided a respite of refined escapism during a troubled time. Its dialogue fizzes and pops first with anticipation at the grand romantic gesture being planned, and then with the anxieties uncovered when James and Mike realize their ardor for their girlfriends is not reciprocated. And the excellent cast delivers its repartee with a nicely calibrated balance between the quips and wit and the grounded emotions underneath the comedy, so the comedy never gets carried away.\n\nWhat works especially well in giving the set of female characters their own agency, POV and agenda in the plot, which gives the proceedings a sense of momentum and movement that can be hard to generate in a short film but is accomplished quite effectively here. Juxtaposing the lads' rose-colored lens of romance against their girlfriends' pragmatism offers humorous contrast, and in many ways, the short is a collision of two buddy movies. But as the stakes rise and each set of characters attempt to save face, hold onto their pride and avoid as much unpleasantness as possible, the escalation of events becomes increasingly convoluted, and ironically can only lead to disaster. \n\n\"The Beach House\" is unabashedly light and entertaining, and manages to stay down-to-earth despite the wealthy connotations of its setting. Polished in look and possessing plenty of charm, the film is the cinematic equivalent of a pleasurable beach read or a bubbly but tart glass of rose, but that's not to minimize its accomplishment. It is actually quite difficult to achieve such nimbleness, which relies on air-tight writing and a unity of performance throughout the film. But in an increasingly weary world, such breeziness is a moment to take a deep breath and enjoy a vicarious vacation, before having to return to the hustle and bustle of everyday life.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But then two boys playing outside one day accidentally shoot a stranger with one of their father's guns.\n\nThey enlist their older sister and an aunt to help clean up the mess and salvage the situation, but as they try to address the situation, the town reveals itself to be odder than thought. The father is still grieving his wife, who has passed away, and everyone else is too preoccupied with their own affairs and schemes to care much.\n\nBut thanks to the persistence of the sister, the town is shaken up, especially the grief-struck father, whose action finally jolts the funny little town forward to come together in an equally eccentric way.\n\nWriter-director Dave Wade's dry, deadpan short comedy is a collective portrait of small-town life, where mores and manners don't change, no matter what happens.\n\nIts sense of humor comes not from gags, quips or antics, but from a mastery of sustained tone and wry observation. When the boys shoot the stranger -- who ends up to be in a lot of trouble himself -- it shakes this little town up, rattling loose a long-dormant eccentricity.\n\nThe writing takes a keen pleasure in observing the ways this small community deals with the event, and much of the humor is found is how nonchalantly Iron Knob's denizens greet the small spark of accidental violence in the midst. Its rhythms and pacing are as ambling and measured as a lizard sitting in the sun, and even when someone is shot and their life threatened, nothing will budge the town citizens from their routine and small affairs.\n\nThe collective portrait of the town that emerges as more and more Iron Knob denizens find out about the shooting is one almost of atrophy, as if addled from too much time in the sun. As fitting to a town in the middle of nowhere, the film has sun-soaked cinematography and a beautiful sense of naturalism and uses these visual tools to create a strong sense of place that adds to the richness of the story.\n\n\"Welcome to Iron Knob\" is much like the town that it evokes: distinctly Australian, offbeat, yet with its own peculiar charm. Viewers will enter a world that saunters along to its own internal rhythms, but it pays off in an ending that is satirically heartwarming and yet still strangely sweet. It's both a paean and a send-up to small towns, and how they can insulate its inhabitants from the rough currents of life -- for better or worse.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Secretly in love with Rach, he hopes the present -- and the reaction it's aimed to provoke -- will also give him the opportunity to declare his feelings and shift their relationship in a more romantic direction.\n\nBut when Rach finally arrives, there just doesn't seem to be a right moment to give Rach her birthday gift, which is truly special and unique: a mysterious space rock from Siberia. When Rach finally opens up her present, though, her lunch with Connor takes a truly unexpected turn, giving rise to Connor's repressed feelings and stifled sentiments.\n\nWriter-director Matt Vesely's spritely, buoyant short has a relatable premise that's formed the backbone of many romantic comedies: someone is secretly in love with, and must summon the courage to tell them how they feel. But a sci-fi twist adds a fascinating complication that makes Connor's journey all the more hard-won -- and makes for both visual spark and terrific physical comedy.\n\nThe film sets up Connor's dilemma in a brisk, economical way, establishing all the key elements of the story. The storytelling sets up Connor and Rach's rapport through an easygoing manner and charming, witty banter, as well as Connor's nervousness. It also cleverly sets up a wobbly chair, the space rock, a disgruntled waiter, and the way Connor wipes his nervous sweat on a chair -- all of which will come into play as the story develops.\n\nThe writing is a small, delightful masterwork in setting up a multiplicity of jokes and gags that pay off in a veritable aria of physical and situational comedy. But it also takes the care to note the tiny internal moments that make for an effective emotional turning point, deftly tracing an arc from hopeful anxiety to fearful retreat.\n\nActor Tom Ward does excellent work both playing Connor's anxiety and clear affection for Rach, and the moment he stifles his truth lands as a small yet piercing heartbreak, while actor Erin James plays Rach as not just a love interest, but a smart, dimensional character with thoughts, feelings and agendas of her own -- one that may be open to Connor's overtures if he ever puts his feelings out in the open. Watching Connor reach that point and find his courage is cleverly and charmingly executed, as well as a proverbial gas.\n\nVisually \"My Best Friend Is Stuck on the Ceiling\" elevates itself above the typical rom-com, with a subtle sense of precision found in the slight sheen of the cinematography and a deliberateness in the camera movement in certain shots that seems more akin to a modern-day sci-fi film -- which of course sets us up for the \"out of this world\" twist.\n\nBut it's this element that finally gets Connor out of his head, helps him chuck all the expectations and painstaking scenarios that he built in his head and truly face the person in front of him. It's this presence -- and the way control of the situation is wrenched away from him in many ways -- that helps Connor level with Rach. And while it ends with the situation up in the air -- all puns intended! -- the real happy ending for Connor is that he's told his truth and found the courage to be emotionally authentic.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

She tosses much of the detritus of his past life into a \"skip,\" a dumpster she's rented during the process.\n\nBut when an unconventional young artist takes Ben's old belongings, Ben follows her and discovers the art she makes with his cast-offs. Rediscovering the joy and spark within his past belongings -- as well as striking up an unconventional friendship with the \"skip girl\" -- gives him back some of his mojo, helping him move forward in his life.\n\nWriter-director Annabel Vine's sharp yet warmly witty comedy is emotionally grounded in one man reckoning with his past -- literally and figuratively -- which helps him also figure out his present and future. Astutely observed and with a lightness of touch that neither overplays the comedy or glosses over the sticky emotions underlying the characters' dilemmas, it's a humorous, affectionate take on the midlife crisis, handled with intelligence and empathy.\n\nLike many comedies grounded in authentic emotional dilemmas, the film succeeds with a foundation of solid, perceptive writing and performances, and the script is able to evoke Ben's entire life and identity in a compact, economical way. It's also helped by a cleanly naturalistic visual sense, particularly in the set and well-chosen props, which play a key role in the storytelling. Tor and Ben's home has the minimalist sleekness of a certain aspirational upwardly mobile milieu, but his \"junk\" has a more lo-fi feel that clashes with his life.\n\nWhat's remarkable is how the performances and writing are able to subtly color each character without caricature, endowing each with a distinctive perspective. Tor could easily be painted as a shrew, but while she seems compulsive about the cleaning-out process, she retains her dignity and viewers get a sense that a film told from her perspective would be equally as funny and illuminating. Ben, too, could easily be played by actor Richard Glover as a \"man-child,\" but instead he's played with a nice balance of genuine bewilderment and frustration at his status in life and a gentle awakening of his more carefree, free-spirited side.\n\nPursuing the titular character in \"Skip Girl\" puts Ben back in touch with this side of himself, but here the writing also avoids typical film cliches. The \"skip girl\" isn't a manic pixie dream girl, but an artist with her own concerns and priorities, and she evokes the pure possibility and creativity of youth, where one improvises art, and even life, based on what's at hand and what's inspiring, unfettered by the often fixed responsibilities of adulthood.\n\nBen has been stuck in a life that he hasn't had a hand in shaping -- either because of his own passivity -- but he realizes that must change going forward. It's something everyone has to reckon with: taking responsibility not just of bills, mortgages, homes and families, but of one's agency and authorship of one's life, and making the rest of existence personal and meaningful.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But when certain doubts arise about his wife's fidelity, he sets out to investigate his suspicions and becomes entangled in a sticky situation.\n\nHe takes refuge by hiding underneath a bed, only to find himself in an entirely new dilemma altogether -- one that brings a whole new revelation about his beloved family to light.\n\nWriter-director Kev Cahill's witty, illuminating short comedy has the visual richness of a drama, especially with its emphasis on deep, saturated colors and murky shadows. A visual atmosphere with this weight and heaviness often portends serious dramas, particularly about oppression within a highly censorious, forbidding world.\n\nBut while religion's influence on modern mores does figure into the story's themes, the visuals form an ornate frame through which an increasing amount of characters bumble through a series of secrets and lies that slowly come to the surface, guided by a well-developed script executed with a terrific eye and ear for both the comedic mishap and the warmth of human bonds and decency.\n\nThe first signal that we're in comedic territory comes right away with the rat-a-tat rhythms and subtle stylization of the banter and dialogue, which reflects both an often mordant Irish wit and the befuddlement of its main character. The ensemble cast -- lead by actor Donncha Crowley in the lead role and a growing Noah's Ark of supporting characters whose identities would give away the story's wellspring of mystery and farce -- plays the performance demands of the storytelling well, staying true to the harmonies and buoyancy of the dialogue while playing the real emotional dilemmas of the people involved.\n\nThe emotional dilemmas faced by these characters are relatable and grounded in social realities, but as Donal navigates the new emotional landscape he finds himself in -- thanks to veritable stuffed clown car of secrets that seem to stream out, one after the other -- he finds himself up against the boundaries between social propriety, his religious faith and his love for his family.\n\nFor its compact length and compressed narrative scope, \"More Than God\" packs in an origami-like set of interlocking stories that unfold with ingenuity and deft craftsmanship. But the film is less interested in being clever and more invested in emotional engagement, and what happens when illusions about the people we love fall from our eyes. Donal is the center of a familial constellation, all of whom are connected both by loyalty and by secrets. But with its multiple dimensions, it's an overarching story about family interconnection, acceptance and love -- all of which forms the glue that keeps families together.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But at her office farewell party, she accidentally eats some chicken, much to her chagrin. She sets about praying to atone for her mistakes and to ask her gods for forgiveness.\n\nAnd yet... she cannot forget the delicious taste of that dish, and her mind is astonished that a dish strictly forbidden as immoral by her religion could taste so good. She sets about trying to find the recipe, which takes her on an inner journey that helps her rethink who she is and how she lives her life.\n\nWriter-director Rahul Chaturvedi's short dramedy -- co-written with Luisa Alvarez Restrepo -- derives its humor not from gags, pranks or surreal conceits, but from the affection and charm that arises when watching someone bump up against the boundaries of the new. The resulting friction propels Gayatri into strange new situations with strange new people, and while it's fun to watch someone formerly set in her ways collide into a new way of seeing and thinking, it's also richly resonant and heartwarming.\n\nThe storytelling is resolutely character-centered, with excellent care and attention paid to laying out Gayatri's life. She faces a big transition with retirement, but her family life doesn't look promising, with a husband and son who don't seem to pay her much attention and often ridicule her for her interest and love of cooking and food. Gayatri's desire to cook a great meal is as much an emotional need for connection as it is an expression of creativity and pleasure in life -- and none of those needs are truly met in her life.\n\nAs she sets out to discover the forbidden yet alluring recipe, Gayatri's world expands, and she learns to find her place and footing in a fast-paced world. The camerawork and visuals capture this section of her journey with both a liveliness and a pleasant ordinariness that is nevertheless warm and friendly -- qualities that are very much like Gayatri herself.\n\nShe is portrayed by lead actor Balindar Johal with great charm, as well as a curiosity and zest for experience that awakens as she delves deeper into a hidden culinary world. As she begins to question the received wisdom that's guided her life so far -- and her idea that getting older means eschewing new interests and passions -- she reawakens to the possibilities of life again.\n\nLike many films about food, \"Forbidden Tikka Masala\" uses the sounds, sights and rituals of the culinary realm as a springboard to explore ideas of tradition, pleasure, togetherness and heritage. And like many films with food at their creative core, the craftsmanship creates its own feast of cinematic pleasures, from endearing performances to heartwarming, engaging storytelling that earns its emotion from truthful, bighearted attention to character. But these tropes are layered over a hopeful, optimistic story that's essentially about reinvention and finding yourself again, no matter what stage in life you're in -- and how looking through a different lens can lead to a new lease on life itself.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

There is nothing usual about this -- except that both are grown women, and Katie is an heiress to a fortune built on waffles. They indulge in all the typical sleepover activities -- ice cream, girl talk -- until it begins to emerge for time for Kerry to leave.\n\nAs it turns out, Kerry has been hired as part of a Uber-type service for friendship. Katie desperately wants Kerry to stay, but Kerry calls for her boyfriend to pick her up. Undaunted, Katie pays for more time and Kerry decides to stay, though not with much enthusiasm. Unbeknownst to her, Katie has other plans in mind for her best friend...\n\nThis comedy-horror short -- directed by Carlyn Hudson and written by co-stars Kerry Barker and Katie Marovitch -- deftly blends sharp, awkward cringe comedy with the taut suspense and dread of the horror genre, all while exploring the complicated knot of need and vulnerability that can fuel intense friendship, as well as the inequalities that can get in the way of genuine reciprocity.\n\nJuggling genres and tones can be a tricky balancing act, but the short admirably modulates between its two poles with aplomb. Like many genres that emphasize pacing and plot, the storytelling is undergirded by a tight, fast-moving and surprisingly complex sense of structure, parsing out zig-zagging information about character, background and world for maximum punch and freshness. It's constantly engaging viewers with small but impactful reveals, an approach that consistently entertains and surprises, but also emphasizes a sense of unease.\n\nThe madcap story is matched by a sense of craft that has considerable panache and a glossy, foreboding darkness, rendering a world that feels real enough to suggest everyday life but removed enough to have an \"Uber for friends\" service. But the real high-wire act belongs to the performances, which can navigate both the absurdist situations of the plot and the thorny emotional reality of friendship with a deeply entitled person.\n\nPerhaps it's because the pair of co-stairs are also co-writers of the screenplay, but both performers hit a difficult, mixing an almost surreal social awkwardness with a breeziness and rhythm associated with screwball comedy. Yet the emotions and dialogue are never played for broadness, staying just on the razor's edge of relatability. Katie's neediness for friendship and her ferocious sense of entitlement is played with an openness that's cringeworthy in its familiarity. But the extreme degree of her neediness and entitlement push the short into true horror territory, complete with a breakneck final sequence that fulfills the genre's demand for a heartstopping ending.\n\nStories of female friendship in film and literature have long examined the codependency, hierarchies and primal fascination that can exist between girls and woman, making these relationships just as complex and rich as romantic ones. But what makes the genre-bending of \"Waffle\" so hypnotic and effective is how it takes the need and vulnerabilities at the heart of these stories and parlays them to the furthest logical conclusion. The result is a wildly entertaining ride that horrifies not just because of the gaping maw of loneliness and toxic entitlement it reveals, but because it's so recognizable to our own emotional lives.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But their free-spirited journey hits a bump as they discover they've hit and run over a dog.\n\nThey discover that the small canine -- called Walter -- belongs to a family of patriotic war veterans. Owning up to their role in Walter's demise, they attempt to inform the family of what happened -- and find themselves embroiled in a culture clash and potentially deadly confrontation.\n\nThis short Australian comedy -- written and directed by Dave Wade and produced by Kirsty Stark -- has a pared-down, slender narrative: it's essentially a small dramatic event and then a resulting difficult conversation and confrontation. But with great wit and brevity and a uniquely dry, laconic tone, the storytelling elevates this tall tale into a small comic gem about cultural and generational divides, all while building a surprising amount of suspense in its compact run-time.\n\nThe visuals have a stylishness to them, with a vintage sun-soaked, burnished tone and an eye for irony and wit in its studied, almost expressionistic framings and detail shots. But this isn't style for style's sake. Instead, it constructs a skewed suburban yet old-fashioned world that Clay and Rocky stumble into, cluttered with the evidence of a very different set of values.\n\nThe real accomplishment of the craftsmanship comes from the rhythms and pacing, which are razor-sharp and quick-witted. The editing moves briskly, often whip-lashing between tones and modes. The story veers between tension and humor, building up small potential spots of violence and then careening into goofiness or whimsy. Yet it also knows when to elongate a moment or detail -- sometimes for comedic effect, sometimes to build tension.\n\nIt also slowly adds to the cast of characters, cramming more types into the small suburban living room of the main scene and building them up through mannerisms and dialogue. The excellent cast of performers clearly has fun with both the archness and broadness of the comedy, balancing the genuine emotions of the action with great comic timing that fits the singular tenor of the film.\n\nAs the proceedings unfold -- and the writing slowly reveals its sly excellence -- the film milks great humor from what has been a terrifically stealthy, precise set-up, which is parlayed into a genuinely suspenseful stand-off -- one that touches at the great ideological divide between the sets of characters, but also lands a wallop of a punchline.\n\n\"Walter\" manages the trick of seeming slapdash and almost manic in execution, but its zig-zag rhythms in tone and pacing disguise a meticulousness in its writing and craft that pays off with an almost perfectly calibrated ending. Its final moments are both of realization on the part of its characters, and relief on the part of its audience -- who may recognize the roots of a cultural gulf that still exists today, and appreciate a momentary bridging of it, however fleeting.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Stuck with one another and with nothing to do, the pair finds themselves scrambling to make the most of their last hour on earth, making their vacation a lot more meaningful than they had planned.\n\nWritten and directed by Michael Feld and Josh Covitt, who both co-wrote the script with Steve Feld, this warm, witty comedy takes a pressure-cooker situation when people are their most unvarnished and vulnerable, throws them into a room together and waits for the very human emotional foibles to come to the surface. It's a film about the apocalypse -- and how we never quite act the way we'd expect in the face of imminent doom.\n\nEssentially a two-hander, like many stories in its format and genre it rests on smart, observant writing, with frank and funny dialogue and a sharp eye for the ways that people hide truths and difficult emotions from one another in an effort to maintain the status quo. Larry and Penny seem like a companionable pair who are deeply familiar and affectionate with each other's flaws. But there are fissures underneath the surface of this vacation paradise, and very real feelings they want to give voice to before it's all over.\n\nWhat gives the story a twist -- and what incites the psychological deep dive -- is the real-life surreal incident of Hawaii's missile alert in 2018, which caused a short but vivid panic for the brief time it was in effect. It causes the couple to quickly reckon with the unfinished business of their life -- which includes an awkward goodbye phone call to their daughter -- even as they pig out on mini-bar food. Of course, they attempt to fulfill their latent long put-off fantasies, but eventually, they're left with nothing but their deepest regrets -- and their deepest love.\n\nActors Julie Brister and Johnny Ray Meeks are terrific as Penny and Larry, who clearly have a great rapport, as well as unforced but deft comic timing. They're clearly comfortable with one another as a long-married couple would be, and don't let one another get away with anything. What works is that they never act out of rancor with one another, but from a clear base of affection and love -- which comes out in an unaffected, unsentimental and ultimately very sweet way.\n\n\"40 Minutes Over Maui\" is in the tradition of great American indie comedy, reminiscent of filmmakers like Alexander Payne, who look at people with an acerbic yet deeply humane lens. It takes the twist of a coming apocalyptic event and looks at how ordinary, flawed and loving human beings still go on being ordinary, flawed and loving, even when faced with the possibility of death and destruction.\n\nThe fantasy is that we become more profound, wise people in these events. But the fact is, people still squabble over in-laws, disagree over sex, rib each other over what they did or didn't do. It's this ordinariness, in fact, that makes life so rich and people so lovable -- something this small gem of a comedy celebrates with aplomb and affection.\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

But after a day full of many slights and insults, he snaps after an altercation on the subway with an obnoxious wealthy couple.\n\nHe's hauled in by the police, who interrogates him about his behavior. And as Charles relays the story of his incident to both the cops and the film's viewers, he reveals the depths of a long-building discontent, as well as the widening of the gulf between powerful and powerless.\n\nDirected by Peter Mackie from a script he co-wrote with Jacqueline Berkman, this short comedy is on the bitter, astringent side, with a sharp, satirical eye for human pettiness while exploring the gulf between the haves and have-nots of one of America's wealthiest cities.\n\nThe film exists within a subset of films made by and about disgruntled New Yorkers, portraying the nitty-gritty, hard-scrabble existence of a group of people jostling for space and resources on a small, crowded island. New York is a place where the combat often starts on the verbal level and the wit cuts sharp, and films in this vein foreground the importance of voice, both in the characters and in the storytelling.\n\nThe writing here succeeds admirably on these terms: voluble, tough and grizzled, Charles sounds and thinks very much like a New Yorker, and his dialogue and cleverly constructed perspective is one of the strengths of the film, along with a committed performance by actor Mark Beltzman in the lead role. His sometimes outrageous choices as a character are played for humor, but while he is often hilarious in his sarcasm and grumpiness, the film also has a moral clarity to make clear that what happens to him is not funny at all.\n\nThe film also hearkens back in some ways to the 1970s, when Hollywood filmmakers applied the freewheeling techniques of European art cinema to the stories, backdrops and concerns of American storytelling. There's a richly grandiose orchestral score that underlies much of the film, which offers an often ironic note to the narrative as it proceeds, especially as Panofsky's irritation and bitterness come to the fore after the pressures of a bad day.\n\nHis bad day isn't just one annoyance after another, however. It's when he faces outright hostility and has his socioeconomic status thrown in his face that he stands up for himself -- though whether or not it leads to any justice remains in question.\n\n\"Panofsky's Complaint\" obviously riffs on the famous Philip Roth novel \"Portnoy's Complaint,\" which itself was a monologue whose linear structure unfurls to reveal the larger social context itself. Though confined to a much narrower narrative scope, the film's central incident reveals who has power and who doesn't, and what ugly prejudices still underlie the surface of so-called civilization. Even with his quirks and peccadilloes, Panofsky emerges as an Everyman in a world where people like him scrabble under the feet of the richer and more powerful, in a system stacked against him.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He's been teaching acting at Cal State Fullerton, but when he's up for an award for his work on the show that made him famous, he mulls over a comeback, though he's reluctant to dive back in. It's a whole new Hollywood, complete with TMZ and hashtags, and Spiner isn't sure it's for him.\n\nBut when his old nemesis LeVar Burton commits to the awards show, Spiner decides to jump back into Hollywood. As he makes the rounds and re-enters in the industry, he finds himself embroiled in the old feud that plagued him during the height of his fame -- and it's still bitter enough to possibly derail his re-entry into Hollywood.\n\nDirected by Sharon Everitt and written by Karen Anderson, Jeff Cosgrove and Everitt, this spiky short comedy has a scope and ambition rare in a genre where punchline skits and sketches dominate. The storytelling is character-based, driven by its protagonist's drive to prove himself and stake out his terrain in a hostile, competitive environment, against a long-running archenemy. Sounds serious, but when the main character is a petty, egotistical star trying to regain his past glory in an industry always looking for the shiny and new -- and you throw in some musical numbers for good measure, along with Frasier actor Peri Gilpin as Spiner's wife and a cameo by comedian Doug Benson -- the result is hilarious, entertaining and a helluva lot of fun.\n\nThe film's strength rests on a great central performance by Brent Spiner, who is playing himself. But it's clearly a heightened portrait of a star who has seen better days and yet still demands the attention of current-day celebrity. Spiner the character is bitter, sarcastic, ego-driven and vainglorious. Spiner the actor is clearly enjoying himself as he sings, dances and preens, with a performance that's both utterly committed to the moment's emotion while winking at the satire of an ego that just won't let go of past glories or grudges.\n\nSpiner traipses from one scene and musical number to the next with a deliciously toxic combination of entitlement and bad attitude, and the rhythms of the storytelling are both amiably laidback yet constantly bubbling with sharply amusing observations. The visual style is also seemingly relaxed and casual as well, in the style of the handheld one-camera comedy that's great at capturing small but telling moments. These moments pile up as Spiner finally confronts his nemesis -- and rethink its long-running effect on his life when it bubbles over into humiliation.\n\nThe delight of \"Brentwood\" is watching an iconic actor poke fun at himself and the peculiarly enduring level of stardom that being on an iconic, much-beloved show and franchise confers. Though Spiner the character has tried to move on, he's not quite where he wants to be despite all his efforts and is both hampered and seduced by his enduring fame to remain in the past. The great irony, of course, is that by lampooning himself and the grip of stardom, Spiner the actor reveals terrific range, comedic chops, and wily self-awareness -- not to mention a facility as an enjoyable song-and-dance man -- and it would be immense fun to follow this story of a former star finding his way in a new Hollywood. Which, after all, isn't so different from the old Hollywood, except with more hashtags on social media and more ways to get famous than ever.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

A man named Reggie gets out with a gun, and then opens the trunk, where another man, Dan, lies bound and gagged.\n\nDan is taken out and a shovel is thrown at him and told to start digging his own grave. Problem is... it's much harder to dig a big hole in the ground than the movies make it seem.\n\nDirected by Kirk Larsen and written by Larsen and Amos Vernon, this subversively witty comedy short uses its strong foundation of excellent craft, writing and performance to portray a potential murder gone awry, to hilarious effect.\n\nThe central conceit of the humor revolves initially on playing with the rules and expectations of genre. The film starts off with an adrenaline rush with beautifully shot but ominously empty desert vistas, taut editing and a tense musical score. The cinematic build-up promises violence and thrills, building up momentum and suspense with each beat, and it obviously draws on Westerns and crime thrillers in both form and content.\n\nBut just as the pace begins to crescendo, the momentum stops as Dan complains that the ground's too hard to dig, and the film shifts into comedy mode. At first, the shift into comedy is brief, as Reggie and the storytelling attempt to get back to the business of dispatching this future corpse. But Dan can't help but keep tugging it back to reality, complaining the ground is too hard and that it will take too long for one person to dig a grave.\n\nThe excellent writing comes to fore and characters deepen, as the two men begin to argue and then finally talk. The narrative here starts to have a little fun, as the forward movement ambles into deep emotional territory for both characters. It's obviously skewed a bit towards heightened parody, but it's played by actors Henry Zebrowski and Amos Vernon with a nimble sincerity -- which only makes it funnier and even rather sweet.\n\nThe sweetness can't last too long, though, because Reggie has to get back to the work of being a hitman, and the final confrontation puts us back into thriller mode, complete with guns and fighting -- though things go down in an unexpected way, once again, with a denouement that's both loopy and yet makes perfectly logical sense in this funhouse mirror of a crime story.\n\nSubversive, witty and self-aware, \"Dig Your Own Grave\" is a terrific showcase of solidly excellent craft, storytelling and performance. But its ultimate cleverness is how it punctures the almost macho conceit of the thriller, with its promise of seamlessly direct violence and force, with the realism and awkwardness of real-life logistics and people, with their insecurities, vulnerabilities, fears and anxieties. The genre -- and the world -- demands a certain overpowering strength and dominance from these men. But trying to live up to that imperative just isn't possible -- and perhaps is folly to begin with.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

As they both wait for a bus that will take them to meetings that could change their fates, they discover that they are connected to each other in cosmic ways.\n\nThis whimsical comedy -- written by co-star Beth Hoyt and directed by Nicole Emanuele -- begins a narrative premise that sounds like the set-up to a quirky joke: \"A nun and a makeup artist wait at a bus stop...\" But as the film unfolds in a uniquely charming way, this set-up resembles more a millennial, quirky take on a Zen koan, inviting insight into the mysterious laws of the universe and cosmic connection.\n\nNot much \"happens\" in terms of plot in the film, but directorial flights of fancy, along with an off-kilter but intriguing sense of visuals, consistently generate intrigue and exert a captivating pull on patient viewers.\n\nThe writing captures the singular voice of each character, and their dialogue together has a stylized rhythm, revealing personalities and histories that are brought to life by actors Hoyt and Shoniqua Shandai in a delightful ease and chemistry. We discover their histories, which parallel one another in the same magical-realist way, and how they're both at a crossroads right at the moment they meet.\n\nThe real magic, however, is found in the detours that the film takes from the main conversation. Creative, fun and lyrical, these musical interludes are a sensory delight with their lyrical camera movement and bright and optimistic colors.\n\nBut these numbers also show both Molly and Dee in literal sync -- a quality of synchronicity that is echoed in the way their conversation overlaps and the similar mannerisms they have. As the characters discover parallels and echoes in one another's lives and personalities, the writing sets up a puzzle of just how much they're connected -- and also how much they may change one another's lives.\n\nIt's hard to encapsulate the overall meaning or feeling of \"Sisters\" within a logline or synopsis since so much of its charm comes from a singular, committed voice and vision. In its self-contained reveries, its bright and artful visuals and its unearthing of poetry under the surfaces of ordinary life and people, it resembles the earlier work of Paul Thomas Anderson -- think more \"Punch Drunk Love\" than \"Phantom Thread\" -- and becomes an oddly enchanting fable about connection and abundance. For Molly and Dee, the magic isn't getting what we wish for --but that we find what we need from one another, bringing us closer together in connection and a strange, mysterious harmony.\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Though they've tried to escape the hectic routines of their lives in the city, they can't quite escape their annoyance with one another. \n\nBut then everything goes awry, thanks to the accidental shooting of a gamekeeper accompanying them. As they try to grapple with the situation and what they've just done, their differences widen and test the fraying bonds of friendship and fraternity, even as they have to work together to get themselves out of their mess.\n\nThe set-up of \"The Lost Scot\" sounds almost like the beginning of a joke: What happens when a cynic, an alcoholic and an accountant get a hold of a gun? But filmmaker Julian Cornwall's comedic short takes that premise and runs with it in an energetic, fresh direction, with terrific writing and flawless creative execution.\n\nMuch of the film's uniqueness comes from juxtapositions. There's the clash between characters' personalities, which sharpen as they deal with their emergency. And there's also the clash between the beautifully desolate (and gorgeously photographed) moorlands setting and the darkly comedic mayhem that ensues.\n\nThis is a particularly verbal comedy, mixing an outrageous and tragic situation with a running torrent of bickering and banter between three very different personalities. The dialogue, as expected, is exemplary, and brought to life by an excellent cast, who balances the comedic demands of the story with the committed collective portrayal of human pettiness, cowardice and self-interest. Each character feels true -- and truly dysfunctional, which makes the increasingly outrageous situation they find themselves in all the more hilarious.\n\nThe plotting here is also excellent, especially for a short comedy, keeping the audience's interest in what happens next as important as the firecracker verbal gymnastics. It's all woven together with timing and pacing in the editing that has an ear for rhythm and an eye for wry visual wit. Punctuated by a famously classical score, the storyline veers into antic directions, but the film's genius treats these narrative roundabouts with the weight of a drama -- which only pays off when they reach the gamekeeper's home and wife and reckon with their actions.\n\nThe ending of \"The Lost Scot\" has a few tricks up its sleeve, but it's also the perfect grace note to a superbly executed dark comedy, which looks into the smallness of human nature and can only laugh at the foibles we can get ourselves into. \n\nOne quibble is that the craftsmanship and artistry may almost too beautifully done for the story. But then again, it may just be the perfect comment on our relationship to our own faults. We may try to put a gloss on our selfishness and pettiness, but in the end, our mistakes and poor decisions all catch up with us in one way or another.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

He's having a hard time in life: he's picked on in his neighborhood because he's weird and awkward, and they break his glasses and call him \"Four Eyes.\"\n\nMeanwhile, his mother Helen is having difficulties of her own, as she struggles to adjust to life as a stay-at-home mom to three kids, raising them completely on her own. She doesn't fit in with the other mothers and feels isolated and depressed, which manifests as impatience and irritation. But when conflict comes to a head for Brian, Helen must rise to the occasion and help Brian stand up for himself -- in the only way she knows how.\n\nWritten and directed by Michael Clowater, this short comedy-drama takes place in 1970s suburbia, and it's rife with fantastic period detail and mores: kids roam freely in neighborhoods on their bikes, talk about the awesome new movie Star Wars and even the \"four eyes\" taunt seems specific to the late 70s and early 80s.\n\nIn many ways, the era of the story deeply influences the style of the film. There's a warm, burnished, textured look to the camera and photography, and a loose-limbed ambling quality to the editing and movement as if life in the suburbs moves at its own pace. The approach gives breathing room for viewers to really get to know the character, and the understated, dry humor lands naturally, without being over-forced.\n\nThe writing has deep empathy for all its characters, aware of how they don't fit in and how they struggle in their worlds. Helen can't quite fake the blithe happiness of the other housewives around her and is frustrated by her life and the aggravations that keep popping up; Brian is targeted for his own vulnerability. They're lost in their own problems, which affect their relationship with one another.\n\nThe performances likewise are deeply honest and unafraid of difficult, thornier emotions. Helen can be abrasive and frustrated with her children, and she doesn't naturally possess the maternal softness of a typical sitcom mom. Tough-minded and no-nonsense, actor Sprague Grayden deftly portrays her escalating frustration with her role as a suburban mom, which comes to a head with Brian's glasses. He breaks them, then loses them, and with no father in the house, she's on her own to deal with it, and unaware of just why they break.\n\nActor Mylo Gosch portrays Brian's embarrassment at his problems and his wariness with his mom's irritability, which keeps him from telling her what's going on. But when the truth finally comes out and Helen becomes aware of Brian's social problems, she teaches him how to stand up with himself. The solution isn't perfect -- but it fits both perfectly to a tee.\n\nRich with irony and eschewing schmaltzy sentimentality, \"Four Eyes\" has the nostalgic spirit of a film like Bad News Bears. But this is a family story above all else, with a warmth and humor that isn't feel-good but earned through the full growth and authentic expression of character. When Helen realizes just what is going on with Brian, her advice and counsel goes against the current parenting mores, and certainly viewed through today's lens of helicopter parenting and over-coddled children, it seems shocking, though very funny. But it's very true to her personality, and in the end, it also expresses her belief in her son's strength, as well as her love for him.\r\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

They decide to go back to the room, where a seductively dressed Jill pours Owen some champagne, they exchange money and they sit on the bed to discuss what they're going to do.\n\nOwen talks about his troubled marriage, even though he and his wife have a baby daughter together. Jill listens, asking him questions and drawing him out. It helps her understand what she needs to do for Owen, she says. But as their conversation continues, things reveal themselves as much different from what they seem, for both Owen and Jill.\n\nWriter-director Corey Shurge's short seems to be a somber slice-of-life narrative, where cleverly constructed and written dialogue reveals unusual depths of character and two people often connect through mutual self-revelation. The film's craft focuses on writing and performance, threaded with moments of often ironic, underplayed humor coming from Owen's lack of self-awareness and, well, lugheadedness. But the storytelling has a craftiness that unfurls itself with slow but sure-handed execution, slyly puncturing expectations and revealing a much darker side to its meaning.\n\nThe noir-soaked, shadowy cinematography has both an ordinary flatness and a moodiness that are reminiscent of Edward Hopper paintings, particularly in a few prominent wide shots that situate small, isolated human figures amidst a barren empty suburban cityscape. Hopper's great paintings explored loneliness, and in many ways, loneliness is the driving emotional force in this narrative, particularly for Owen, who is played with subtlety and sympathy by actor Aaron Merke with a wounded everyman quality. Owen's marriage is troubled; he says his wife hates him and verbally abuses him, calling him insults like the one that inspires the film's title. Viewers understand why he is looking for solace and sex elsewhere.\n\nThe other element in this narrative equation is Jill, played by actor Jade Michael in a clever, sophisticated performance that offers a cryptic and mysterious contrast to Owen's more vulnerably open character. Part of Jill's enigma is due to her work, and part of it is due to her narrative function in the first half of the film, where she functions as a sounding board for Owen's marital woes. But with a subtle sleight of hand, the writing and dialogue reveal the unvarnished truth of both Owen's situation and Jill's role, deftly undercutting expectations, shifting the genre and propelling the narrative into an unexpected conclusion.\n\nWe'd love to say more about how the film's seemingly modest craftsmanship reveals itself to be controlled and confident in the end, or how Owen's conception of himself as a victim is undercut by his blind spots. But that would give away what makes watching \"Lughead\" so fun and engaging. What we can say is that the short's surprises are entertaining but also thought-provoking, and with the unsettled feelings it evokes, viewers may be thinking about Owen and Jill well after the story ends.\n\r\nABOUT OMELETO\r\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.

Glen is trying to get to his family in the midst of a medical emergency, and he's trying to travel as quickly as possible.\n\nBut when they're stopped on the way by a cop, things take an ominous turn as they're subjected to questions and demands undergirded by pernicious assumptions. As the passengers navigate the interrogation and police officer tightens his focus on the passengers, the situation escalates into a potential powder keg, threatening to detonate with just one small wrong move.\n\nThis dramatic short -- by writer/director Steven DeGennaro and co-writer Scott Weinberg -- unravels in essentially real-time as it tracks the rising tensions during a traffic stop. But by taking a forensic lens to its compressed dramatic scale -- and never being afraid to ratchet up the suspense and tension -- it exposes the ways that assumptions about race and power seep into the interactions of everyday life.\n\nMuch of the action confined to the space of the car, putting us in close proximity to the passengers and emphasizing the unpredictability of the officers outside. Within such a small physical location, the storytelling leans heavily on its writing, weaving in ideas, emotions and attitudes.\n\nBut it is also precise in meting out each escalation of tension, whether it's in a seemingly offhand yet pointed comment or taking a moment too long in answering a question. The action here is in words, gestures and silences -- but their impact is just as powerful and potentially dangerous as bombs.\n\nDespite the claustrophobic space, the film still has a strong visual signature. Heavy with inky-dark shadows pierced by harsh invasive lights, the story is shot with an eye to the ominous and unpredictable. In many ways, it resembles a horror movie -- only the real-life phantom is the threat of potential police retaliation and brutality that hangs over so many incidents like this across the country. And as the fear and dread heighten -- an arc so deftly captured by the precise, specific performances of the excellent cast -- it takes just one careless comment to unleash the spectre of potential retaliation.\n\nClearly crafted to provoke discussion, thought and a boots-on-the-ground emotional immersion into an experience that some may never encounter -- and some know all too well -- \"Stop\" ends on a something of a cliffhanger. The ending supplied by the imagination of the viewer -- as well as their judgments on the actions of the characters -- could conceivably function as a Rorschach test on where you stand on an incendiary subject. Some may imagine the worst; some may hope for better. Mostly everyone, though, will be left on the edge on their seat, gripped in an unresolvable, thorny tension that continues to haunt headlines still.\n\nABOUT OMELETO\nOmeleto is the home of the world's best short films.
